So I've had a crush on this really cute girl I had a few classes with. She's really popular but most of the other guys don't really notice her (three guys didn't know who she was at the mention of her name).  newlinechar  newlinechar She's really sweet and nice and also looks really pretty imo. She has a very cute, kinda artsy (but not too artsy) fashion sense but doesn't seem basic at all. And she sings really well and plays multiple instruments. Also we have a common hobby that I can talk to her about. newlinechar  newlinechar We talk relatively often and judging by some signals of hers (looking at me a lot during class, blushing when I compliment her etc.) she might actually like me back. But maybe she doesn't idk
You aren't wrong, that's all I could think of free that would be close.
Well as I figured out it is still possible to put a Pokemon between active gym fights. Someone could always spare the timer, even more effective if two or more people are starting the gym fight non-simultaneously to prevent anyone from adding their pokemon. newlinechar  newlinechar But that does only apply as long an fight is active. As soon all fights ended a Pokemon can be added. Just happened tonight as someone added Pokemon in the right moment while we were starting the second fight.

Absolutely! 
I'll stop short of absolute horror/NSFL (but still pretty gross) so as not to be a downer. newlinechar  newlinechar Important background information, when I was young I lived on a fairly straight, but steep hill. I'd say around a 20-30 degree incline, and maybe 200 yards long. I also lived near a man-made neighborhood lake, which had a 5 or 6' drainage pipe at one end to handle overflow. newlinechar  newlinechar One year, they did a replacement on the top 3 or 4' length of said pipe and just sort of tossed the original aside near the lake. I'm guesstimating on size since I was a kid, it was just about right for my 10-year-old self to climb inside comfortably though. So my buddy and I looked at the hill, looked at the pipe, and came up with the brilliantly fun plan to take the pipe up the hill and take turns riding down in it. I was chosen to go first because my friend ~~was an asshole and wanted to see if I'd die~~ thought it was a good idea and I was a passive sort. newlinechar  newlinechar So we roll the pipe up to the top of the hill, I get in and start my roll down. It was horrifying, frankly, and I was shocked I didn't break any bones being tossed around in there. Here's where it gets fun: the hill ended in a cul-de-sac with a storm drain. We didn't have any real plan for stopping, which only occurred to me as I hit the flatter ground of the cul-de-sac and realized what was about to happen. newlinechar  newlinechar So yeah, I hit that storm drain, and due to the momentum the pipe went flying over the drain, tossing me out where I landed in the drainage ditch the drain flowed into, which was full of sticks, leaves, and as I slowly regained coherence from the fall I realized one more thing. newlinechar  newlinechar It contained the decaying body of a full-grown Elk, and I was in the middle of it with its half-rotted skull about a foot from my face. The smell I'd originally taken as your normal drainage reek was actually about a thousand pounds of decaying flesh. I was inside the body of a massive, dead animal. newlinechar  newlinechar Later inquiries determined that the guy who lived at the foot of the hill had gone hunting a few weeks before, and wanted the skeleton but didn't want to bother with cleaning it. So he just tossed it in that ditch and waited for time and nature to take its course. newlinechar  newlinechar [thanks buddy](#ptsd)

&gt; And then the other boys agreed and Cartman said he thought the Mormon kid was pretty cool. newlinechar  newlinechar Actually they don't.

It makes perfect sense for him to be angry when their worldview makes no sense. There is nothing wrong at all with being angry and honest about it. Stan is an authentic person who genuinely cares about other people.  newlinechar  newlinechar The mormon family is only nice on the surface. After Stan yells at them they act like nothing happened, because they didn't actually care about Stan or his feelings at all. If they actually cared they would be honest and genuine with him and talk to him about his concerns. Honestly those type of people give me the creeps. Being angry and sad is natural, and acting like everything is ok all the time is just what a cult does to get people to join it.  newlinechar  newlinechar Stan is totally right, they just blindside stupid people by ACTING nice.

I like it. Some people won't. If you like it, that's what really matters. As writers, we should only write about the things we want to. You can't worry about whether or not something will be received poorly. This is a good chance to present a topic that is rarely explored (lying about sexual assault) because of the nature of the subject. It's doubtful that because of this you would be painted as someone who is insensitive towards sexual assault or someone who thinks that most women lie about their situation. I say go for it. If anything, it presents a different sort of ugly side to these situations, because sometimes that sort of thing does happen. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe if you were to have her to go a sort of rape recovery clinic or something like that for some reason (possibly out of guilt, the fact that she's trying to lie to herself to get others to believe her, or because she wants to understand what someone who was raped really feels like after the fact and how they would cope.), you could show the side of the story that reveals the true nature of the suffering that a rape victim (male or woman) experiences despite the fact that your character was not actually raped.

Adults stand about 60 to 76 centimeters (2.0 to 2.5 ft) tall at the shoulders. The length of adult males is around 2.4 meters (8 ft) long nose to tail, with overall ranges between 1.5 and 2.75 m (5 and 9 ft) nose to tail suggested for the species in general. Males typically weigh 53 to 90 kilograms (115 to 198 pounds), averaging 62 kg (137 lb). Females typically weigh between 29 and 64 kg (64 and 141 lb), averaging 42 kg (93 lb).

Take your time and read the points that have been made. What was my original statement? It was that men earn more than women, savvy?

To only add to the spuriousness he disclaimed that there was no **overall** male privilege. newlinechar  newlinechar Now, you must appreciate that I have illustrated my point by rendering onto OP two credible sources- one being directly from the government- which clearly demonstrate my point which is, if you deign to read this time, that men earn more than women.

4 months doesn't mean 120 days of straight playing. I've usually been able to play on the weekends only. Let me explain it to you - let's say you go to the movies and spend $30 on two tickets and a popcorn and soda. You sit down and realize the chair you're in is sticky because someone spilled soda on it, and now your @$$ stinks. You switch chairs. You realize there's someone next to you who's laughing and talking extremely loudly and is making it hard for you to enjoy the movie. You watch the movie, and leave feeling disappointed because while you enjoyed the plot and acting, and the emotional moments, the movie was extremely short and seemed low-budget with cheesy effects and the camera wasn't working properly either, causing some frames to drop. newlinechar  newlinechar Makes sense?

I'm not a lady, but I do post M4F NSFW content. I think many women grew up with the societal pressures that female sexuality should be hidden. I've met a lot of women who feel uneasy or ashamed about sections of their sexuality. Also, I'd imagine that women can feel incredibly vulnerable, especially in NSFW subreddits where men dominate, because they receive pushy or otherwise unwelcome messages when they expose themselves. But yea, men certainly receive much fewer replies than women, except for maybe M4M.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, I have received quite a few incredibly kind and sexy messages from women on Reddit. My only advice would be to be a consistent poster, so people can get to know you better, and to post to a variety of subreddits.

Yes I suppose it ultimately comes down to trust. If you believe they are treating all creditors equally, and they're doing their best to dig their way out of a hole, then it might be best to sit back and wait.

Kizer has got to be up there as one of if not the most botched prospect of all time.  I doubt he was gonna be a perennial All-Pro, but the way the Browns have handled him this season couldn't really get any worse.  The had him start day 1 when the general scouting consensus was he was the least NFL ready of the top QB prospects.  Not the end of the world, but the team didn't have much to gain by rushing him into the game.  Then they benched him.  Then started him.  Then benched him again.  Then the coaching staff made it clear they wanted Jimmy Garopollo at the deadline and pouted that the FO didn't make it happen.  Now they are pitching a fit because they also wanted AJ Macarron and ~~apparently the FO botched that because of timing~~ it sounds like the Bengals goofed up the paperwork and the trade didn't happen as a result.

Yeah the Armed Forces bowl has contracts with Army, the American, and the Mountain West to ensure that, if eligible, every year will feature Army, Navy, or Air Force. This year is Army's contract year so they're locked in although I believe that a CFP chosen bowl would supersede the contract so a NY6 or playoff spot could allow them into another bowl

The question is though how can you be sure they need this if most people are raised within these institutions and taught to think this way? Coping with reality often seems to involve a predisposition created by one's upbringing anyway. If you're raised to believe there's life after death having that taken away seems far more frustrating than being raised with no such presupposition.

One of the funniest things I've ever seen in person was a little kid run full speed into the trash can attached to a busser's cart. Kid was running full speed, looking back over his shoulder and screaming while carrying a double handful of mints he had snatched from the bowl by the register. He hit that trashcan with a resounding *THUNK* and 20 something mints scattered everywhere like he was some kinda snot-nosed piñata. Fell flat on his ass and started crying at which point his parents finally took notice.  newlinechar  newlinechar I was laughing so hard I was crying too. newlinechar  newlinechar tl;dr: kid did a sonic impression but with mints instead of rings

Thanks buds for your positive encouragements to post a GOTD. I actually intended to skip that day as it was a very busy day. But now, as things calmed down, I started my research for tomorrow's picks, but this Lakers match is still somehow on my mind. I'm favoring the Lakers, but I expected way lower odds for Detroit and much better HC bets for LA, but the odds and lines only changed marginally throughout the day and I actually intended to put just money on LA when odds getting more favorable. But it's too tempting for me to not put money on that match. We had very profitable GOTD picks the last days and I'm going to watch this match anyway. I'm really looking forward to that NBA clash. It's going to be a very exciting and interesting match. BOL everybuddy.

Breaking up tasks to reasonably small sizes, and encouraging frequent PRs can help with visibility. newlinechar

Don't let that stop you. Cthulu is madness incarnate right? Why couldn't he take another of his warlocks and drive him so insane he believes he is the formar warlock. The players keep meeting and foiling his plans in their quest to break the pact. The shadow version (he's all shadowy like Dark Link in my head) keeps antogonizing the party saying things like the Raven Queens power can't save a promised soul, and they'll never break the pact. This recurring enemy when finally destroyed is revealed to have never truly been the old warlock. The players will have some relief they're friends soul isn't being tormented, and they can finally end the pact with Cthulu, freeing him to return to the living.

I think you are right, but I also kind of put a lot of weight on my friend's words who have Shibas and such dogs that help them go around woods alone because they bark and growl when someone without great character tries to come closer.

Your question is basically asking why medicine is better than homoeopathy. newlinechar  newlinechar PoS just doesn't work, it's a logical tautology.  It expects you to use the content of the blockchain to decide the content of the blockchain. newlinechar  newlinechar Proponents of PoS have responded by laying incredible amounts of complexity-- so that it's not worth people's time to review and publish attacks-- but this just makes the systems obscure not secure.  Other times they use unphysical assumptions which can't possibly hold-- like assuming the users have a synchronous network (if they did, they wouldn't need a blockchain at all-- just take the first spend), or refuse to discuss their specific security model in order to hide the lack of soundness. newlinechar  newlinechar There is a good paper on the subject [here](https://download.wpsoftware.net/bitcoin/pos.pdf).

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree. Neither Clemson or VTech have any strong wins outside of maybe Clemson's win over Auburn and Auburn isn't truly a top 20 team. Clemson, TCU, Wisconsin, V-Tech, Miami, Auburn, LSU, and Miss State are all way too high for what how they've played so far. Clemson lost to a 4-4 Syracuse team and Ohio State lost to a legit contender in Oklahoma I'm really not buying this. I understand OSU has gotten leeway in the past, but OSU never lost to Minnesota.

That depends entirely on you. Personally, I carried from Silver 5 to Plat 3 simply double soaking lanes. The amount of soak lost in lower levels is absurd. So I just drafted the regular double soakers like Gul'dan and Xul, and even sometimes Murky, and just maintained a 2 level exp lead most of the game. newlinechar  newlinechar From High Plat to Masters, I had to carry harder in teamfights and play the heroes I am most effective with. For me those are warriors and solo laners. So I played (and now play) a lot of Muradin, Anub, Johanna, Malthael, Leoric, and so on. newlinechar  newlinechar My warrior / off-melee / melee assassin play is far better than my ranged assassin / support play, and at High Diamond - Masters it becomes very important to play your hero to high effectiveness. I just can't do that the same way with most ranged heroes and supports as I can with tanks and bruisers/melee dps.

&gt;  As it stands there can be no good gameplay with CVs no matter how the numbers are balanced. newlinechar  newlinechar No matter how much you repeat this, it won't somehow become true. You simply don't like the existence of a hard counter to warship-grade magical invisibility cloaks. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;In any case the impact of their ludacrous vision superiority is terrible for gameplay. newlinechar  newlinechar That's backwards. Stealth, the ridiculous stealth arms race, is terrible for gameplay. One of the factors in high tier passivity is that ships get so stealthy you never now when you might get ambushed by half the enemy force, or just one battleship with cruiser-like concealment out to make yet another surprise deletion gif. Do I need to remind everyone here how much of a no-brainer Concealment Expert and the concealment module are on damn near every ship out there? newlinechar  newlinechar Stealth is what makes DDs still the second most popular class (games with four-five DDs per side are regular sightings on EU) despite torps being laughably non-threats, despite BB AP, despite radar/sonar creep, and, yes, despite the couple CV players still clinging to existence. Because being the stealthiest ship around grants you better survivability than any armour and lets you single-handedly win the late game. newlinechar  newlinechar In and of itself that needs not be bad; that simply means it is desirable that there exist counters to such a strong ability. If information and the concealment thereof is to be such a key element of battle, then there needs to be ways to fight the information battle. Carriers can excel at it, at the opportunity cost of dedicating and eventually expending planes with a different original purpose and while having to fend off their counterpart. It could be the job of DDs, but all too often they won't take on the task; someone has to.

None of these stats are based on actual literal facts, that’s the weird part. It’s all extrapolated based on a sample of Nielsen viewers. It doesn’t work like a website where they can see any given day how many viewers they have, it’s all based on “Nielsen households.” That act as a gauge for the rest of the audience. newlinechar  newlinechar I may have a few things slightly off, but ratings really aren’t as accurate as people think.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Look up Set Meters, you’ll get a better idea of the system. Not sure if it’s still used or if a new replacement has come along.  newlinechar  newlinechar Honestly wouldn’t surprise me if a big part of the collapse of the cable industry was the Nielsen ratings, wouldn’t surprise me in the least if it turned out they weren’t an accurate representation.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit2: .. downvoted for .. facts?

&gt; This allocation strategy has trouble allocating resources towards new projects efficiently (innovation). In a market economy, resources set aside for new projects are able to move anywhere in the economy and are incentivized to move to where they are most efficiently used (where they are the most profitable). Risk disincentivizes people from allocating resources towards questionable projects. It isn't clear how to have free movement of resources set aside for new projects in a decentrally-planned economy. Only locally produced resources would be able to be used in new projects even if there are other parts of society where those resources could be used more efficiently. newlinechar  newlinechar Decentralized economic planning wouldn't be completely and utterly constrained to local production and consumption; it just prioritizes it to help solve the [local knowledge problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_knowledge_problem) and encourage efficiency.

CU enacted the precise thing that was claimed, albeit not word for word, but it sought to ensure that corporations shared the same freedoms as individual American humans and favored legislature that encompassed that.

The problem is not language but common identity and common culture.  newlinechar  newlinechar If different languages don't split identity like in Switzerland you can have a multi-lingual country. The culture can be internaly diversified, but it must contain a strong enough common component.    newlinechar  newlinechar The most important is awareness of togetherness = common identity. It is American problem from the begining. White Americans are descendants of people who decided to leave Europe to become Teddy Roosewelt's unhypenated Americans. Black people are descendants of people who were dragged in America to be slaves of white Americans. It is not a good base for a common identity. People comming from Latin America are coming to live in USA but stay themselves. The same important part of Muslims. A common language would not help. Irish people speak English now.

If you ask ten people you'll get ten different answers. newlinechar  newlinechar In my opinion it's a mixture of not getting sufficient experience early on in school when you are making these decisions, need for more patient interaction, fear of encroachment (which by the way is massively overblown) and ego. newlinechar  newlinechar By ego I mean a lot of the time you are not acknowledged for your efforts and if you do your job right, it's like you never existed at all. Many of us came into medicine to help people and feel gratification as we did that. Well if there's no gratification, how are you going to feel rewarded?

Talk to any current provider and they will tell you that it won't happen in 30 years. I plan on doing a fellowship if I do gas just to make myself indispensable - I'll either do pain or critical care so I'll have a back up plan if I end up being a babysitter in 15 years. newlinechar  newlinechar To each their own.

Varies vastly, but generally I would say that if they are to be jailed for 10+ years it's cheaper to kill them. There are more upfront costs, but the costs of holding someone in hi-sec ramp up extremely quickly especially if you're talking about a life sentence with inflation. But again, depending on duration of sentence, probability of parole, and expected wait time (barring delays which naturally are pushed for) the exact costs will vary a ton. newlinechar  newlinechar

I have been at multiple schools, a community college, large state school, and a smaller private non-profit currently. None of the schools have had anything like that. Even teachers, who might personally be quite liberal which challenge you to back up why you believe what you do, even if they agree with it. In ethics classes to economics, I have had teachers and students play devils advocate to make you actually have a coherent and rational basis for your arguments. It sucks that people seem to have such negative experience because I have never seen people group up on someone for a view like you described but it seems to be common according to Reddit.

You are correct about the fact that a random white dude managed to kill 50+ people, but you are still wrong about one thing.  We are told that he had no motive whatsoever; that he didn’t kill in the name of a religion, a race, a political affiliation, or a gender.  It is apparent that the shooter was mentally ill, and if that is not the case, we are being lied to about what really happened that night.  Here lies the problem; these religious extremist are killing because of the fact that other people have different belief systems, and live life in a way that is different from the way most Muslims do.  No one can convince them that there is even the slightest possibility that their beliefs aren’t the end all be all.  They hate anyone that isn’t like them, and they are willing to do whatever they must to get rid of them.  This isn’t just an issue here in the U.S.  This problem is affecting the entirety of the globe, and countless cultures/nations are systematically being destroyed.  These people simply can not assimilate to the way of life that other cultures practice, and have practiced for centuries.  They see the world and everything in it as theirs, and they think that because they are convinced that only they are right about just about every aspect of life.  I have friends and family in European countries, and the things that they have told me about how they are losing their own countries and customs as a result of the never ending stream of Islamic people into their homelands is disturbing.  You would be amazed by the things that I have been told in regards to Islamic migrants trying to force their way of life onto the local people who’s families have been present there for centuries.  The people that I have spoken to about the subject are very progressive and have always associated with the left when it comes to politics, except for maybe one or two.  The way that they describe how they feel about what is being done to their history and their way of life would make one think that they are ultra-conservative.  It is really that bad over there.  I really don’t want to see the same things happen to the U.S., and trust me, most of you would agree if you saw and heard what I did.

In the end the difference between the two websites came to $4. This included shipping costs. I never said other retailers were selling them for a loss but that they purchased them at $20 from Innova. I have not come across them for cheaper than that.  It is not uncommon for companies to sell something at cost to promote their business or in hopes of additional purchases and return business.  In the end 1010 was willing to lose $1.00 for my return business which they will get due to the awesome customer service.  newlinechar  newlinechar Here is their exact reply: newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for your purchase! We have $20 into each of the Sexton Firebirds we've purchased. Innova wouldn't provide us retailers a discount on the USDGC Firebirds. We are curious how Infinite can charge less then the Innova Proshop does when we were told no dealer discounts? Anyway, maybe they are selling them at what they have into them in hopes the customers will buy some others. Most people don't realize dealers have to pay full price for the USDGC birds.   newlinechar  newlinechar We have $20pc into the Firebirds you purchased plus our shipping cost that is almost $5 with postage and the box cost. We are willing to take a $1 loss and match them. We beat Infinite Discs in overall pricing, so be sure to check back with us for any other disc needs you have. We have finished adding pictures of most of the discs we have in stock as well. Fun fact. Any disc with (UN) next to the color is a unique disc which includes swirls or unique coloring.

Maybe you got crits when you needed to, your AOE never missed, all the enemy stuns missed. It could happen. Sometimes shit just works out ya know? But even then it should have been close. You’re saying that you “easily” beat the event with that team? .....how?

The raid is Calus testing us. When it's done he basically says good job, here's some guns, and now we're temporary allies. When Calus was drifting in space for millennia, he eventually reached a wall of nothingness, and saw that something powerful was staring back at him. Since then, he's gone through the universe forcibly recruiting allies by threatening their planet and then making them complete his challenges on the leviathan. He believes that some unstoppable force is coming to end the universe. Eating Nessus was either to make some wine or just something to provoke us to board the leviathan.

Thousands of antique firearms are used daily in by civilians in the US and [insurgents fighting actual war.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IErsZx5Z1qw) newlinechar  newlinechar Some surplus arms *do require* careful ammunition selection to prevent damage.

It is always a good idea to look around for literature on what is safe to shoot in your gun *before* taking it to the range. newlinechar  newlinechar **Bullshit Rating:** High - The alternative history thing has no basis in reality, but some guns can be damaged by shooting ammunition that is hotter than the original design intended. newlinechar  newlinechar **Category:** Combination of a cautious neophyte and a rambunctious troll. newlinechar  newlinechar **Related Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQ_F1riBth8 newlinechar  newlinechar **Unrelated Video:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1S43E9jq9w newlinechar  newlinechar *Swag:* http://www.redbubble.com/people/gatfactsswag newlinechar  newlinechar **Gun in the photo:** - [Dutch Beaumont-Vitali 71/88](http://candrsenal.com/briefly-dutch-beaumont-vitaly-7188/) newlinechar  newlinechar

I moved here from Slovakia to study law when I was 19 together with my brother. I stayed for the world-class education, international business culture, extremely humble and helpful people and inclusiveness of the communities I lived in. Sadly, I am considering leaving now as I feel though the inevitable economic decline and decrease in living standard for a large part of the population will empower the anti-immigrant feels even more. I live in Manchester now and I witnessed hate incidents on the tram which involved locals yelling at foreign language speakers to go back where they came from - it happened to my colleague as well who is Bulgarian. I don’t feel comfortable speaking my own language in public with my brother these days to avoid any potential troubles. I’ve got a few brexiteer colleagues who keep reassuring me I am “the good kind” of immigrant and they won't send people like me back, which has never been a reassurance to me. This argument by itself is irrelevant to the hardline anti immigrant folks who voted to get rid of us as we “steal their jobs”. My entire time here, I have always strived to give back to the community and participated at charity events to raise money. Even now we are running a project in my department at work to help Macmillan with their retention and engagement of charity members. As much as I integrated, contributed back to the society I feel as though my time here has run out. UK has and will always be the place where I grew up and got to know the “bigger world”, but in reality a large part of it was possible thanks to the EU. In fact, always felt that UK brings balance to EU thanks to its healthy scepticism and it is an integral part of the EU values I stood by. If it wasn’t for the EU my schools back home wouldn’t have proper school grounds, teachers from the US, ERASMUS nor would I be able to travel, live and work anywhere I wanted. I feel am the child of EU and I am saddened that my British peers perhaps might not get to enjoy the same benefits I had. This along with the societal changes I have witnessed in the short time make me think that it’s time I leave. Anyway, sorry if this was too long of a read and I just feel like all of this self inflicted harm in the form of Brexit has created a pressure on me and it’s challenging to wake up day by day knowing the country I love will no longer be the home I wanted it to be. 
Impressive length.

Dan's reasoning personally doesn't make *any* sense to me, but ah well. :)
I've never spent more than 3.5 weeks on a passage - can't imagine much longer, especially on a 50 footer.  In port I've seen some algae growth creeping up above the waterline, but I haven't seen anything like the growth on their hull - splash zone, maybe. newlinechar  newlinechar On the other hand, I searched for Fukushima boats that drifted across the Pacific to the west coast.  Here's [an example](http://nwnewsnetwork.org/post/three-years-later-where-did-japanese-tsunami-debris-go).  No obvious algae - plenty gooseneck barnacles though.
We don't know, and it's sitting in about 3200 feet of water, so we'll never know. Two theories, though -- we were reeling in a marlin at the time it sank, and the captain was going into reverse occasionally to keep the line running off the stern. A few big waves came and nailed the stern and completely soaked us, so when that happened, the most likely theory: the force of the wave knocked a rubber hose coupling for the exhaust loose, which no bilge pump could overcome. The other theory: if the rudder was turned when one of the waves it, the wave basically knocked one of the rudders out, which would also overwhelm your average bilge pump. We did hear a strange crackling/scraping sound through the hull at some point, so that could've been it...
Never argue with rejection. Just shrug and move on. Let me also say I don't point out someone is wrong until they realize they're wrong and then I take a minute to rub their face in being wrong.
They don't matter as much as we all think. newlinechar  newlinechar Because of the power of blood gems and the way softcaps work, a little stat investment goes a long way. Consider that 3 x 27.2% tempering gems provide a physical damage multiplier of 2.06! The Saw Spear at 25/25 str/skl with these gems has an AR of 547. The Rakuyo with 25 skill and no strength investment has an AR of 506. The Holy Moonlight Sword at 25/25/15 str/skl/arc has an AR of 701, 629 of it physical. Imagine a BL70 invader with these weapons and gems. newlinechar  newlinechar You can destroy NG and cruise through depth 5 FRC dungeons with these damage values. And as OP showed you can crush tough bosses in NG+ at the lowest level. Blood gems are stupidly good if you have the patience to get them.

Because the communists where not destined to win. They actually got very lucky. newlinechar  newlinechar 1) a weaker US may change how Russia gets to expand into Alaska and Hawaii, the Russians had two forts on the island and if the africans where incapable of taking they might have. The americas are close to Russia than England is to Australia.  newlinechar  newlinechar A stronger colonial presence there would lead to more troops already positioned in Asia and the america to support them so that if/when the Russo Japanese war breaks out the Russians would overwhelm them. This would allow the Russians to keep Manchuria and port Arthur making the tsar much richer. newlinechar  newlinechar 2) Wirth a balkanized and weak america Europe may be more willing to spend money trying to stop the revolution.

Well, it all depends on the reaction you want if you ever get in the situation of being attacked or threatened. Most dogs do not ever go beyond barking (which is good in general). It takes years of training and very strict obedience to get a specific reaction from a dog. A well trained dog will know the difference between a man coming up and making small talk and the same man starting to say threatening words. The protection dog will also go beyond the bark threshold and will bite/attack a person if they show very aggressive behavior and note, not when you tell the dog to bite. Lastly and even more importantly, a well trained dog can be recalled from an attack at any second.  newlinechar So, yes, big goals to train a real protection dog.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you only want a bigger dog that may scare off some strangers and may bark threatening then I think it's important to look at the puppy's demeanor. You will want to pick a bold puppy. newlinechar  newlinechar Even my small border collie mix will protect me if a stranger would come at me. He probably wouldn't bite but at least bark and make a big fuss.

I'll get him to 100% because Super TEQ on Global doesn't really have a secure 6th man if you run the LR Goku variant of the team. Tien is nice, but not necessary and he techinally isn't any better then running an orb changer in the 6th spot if you don't count his 40% attack boost. WT Fat Buu, 2nd Anniversary SSJ2 Goku, TEQ SSJ Gotenks, and even Icarus Kid Gohan all do well as a 6th man currently along with Tien for whomever summoned for him. In my opinion, with Candy Vegito being farmable, I can see him being another clutch unit to fill the 6th slot on Super TEQ's LR Goku variant. Maybe even in place of Base Vegito if you aren't only interested in damage numbers and like to think of creative team builds.

I'd disagree with unit balance considering how imbalanced the roster is weapon-wise but the other things are very true and people really do need to realize it.
I'd rather they make MM decent then make all pubs look like Merasmus' map. newlinechar  newlinechar TF2 is a warzone in pub play. Take any iconic choke like badwater 1st's hallway to 2nd. At any given moment there are rockets and grenades flying through, Snipers picking people off, Blu likely has a level 3 watching the corner with a dispenser healing a bunch of people while Red has multiple sentries up on roof and on the floor attempting to block Blu, Pyros are spraying flames to spycheck, there's a lot of death, destruction, and yelling.  newlinechar  newlinechar Competitive on the other hand is quiet. There's spurts of action and an occasional scattergun pop or two on flank but overall it's very quiet. This fits fine for a sport-like setup but I don't really play pubs to play TF2 like a sport, I play it to play a war simulator. That's not even going into the toxic nature of lower playercount games and how unforgiving they are inherently and indirectly how unforgiving they make it's community. newlinechar  newlinechar While I enjoy competitive, I don't see it as TF2 proper. Competitive is a sport, not a warzone. The day TF2 stops facilitating both of these needs is the day I'll likely get ready to quit.

For people already on board with the DC cinematic universe I'm seeing positive reactions but from the people who aren't sold on it I'm seeing more negatives. For me personally its jarring, but if you're willing to accept Batman but with guns, the Flash but slow (relatively speaking), and Cyborg but Iron Man it's probably amazing.  newlinechar  newlinechar Anyway,  that's just my two cents since I know there are going to be people here who absolutely love this clip who are confused why anyone could dislike it.

But it's not even that. I used to be super fat. Like worryingly fat near the end of my teenage years, and I was conscious of it. I was active. I know I was. I skateboarded my entire teens, played ultimate frisbee (not well), and biked a 120 mile day and a half ride every year for my church for 6 years.  I was fat though. And I know, calories in v. calories out is all you need. But I did take care of myself. I had a healthy heart rate and blood pressure (I was a kid though so I'm sure my body was more resilient just because). I feel bad that some people think all fat people are gross no matter what size. When people are scary fat though, that's scary to me. At some point people eventually need to lose weight to live a better healthier life and there's no denying that. 
Also, no my hand is not deformed.

The guy was creating chances all game last night and has been creating chances all year. The issue is Carpenter and Ward can't seem to bury any of Meier's set ups and their only real offensive ability is at cycling.

so you don't think that people have a right to choose who to associate with? this is not a criminal proceeding. we are all continually judged to a much lesser standard by society around us on a daily basis. newlinechar  newlinechar racism itself is not illegal, but its social intolerance has come a long way. still a long way to go, but it is better than it was. social pressure also leads to new laws. societal acceptance of something changes and laws change to reflect it. the fact he may not be guilty of any crime does not mean his actions are tolerable. newlinechar  newlinechar and again, he is really free to defend himself and has chosen not to. also a film crew can choose not to work with you for any reason they see fit, barring protected class

Without any goddamn every-two-words twinspeak.  newlinechar  newlinechar In all seriousness, I think it's best if they're subtle in their differences. Something that can only be noticed if you know the both of them a lot, you know? At least that's what I like. newlinechar  newlinechar I made my Fred just a bit more... thoughtless? Insensitive? I'm not really sure what word to use, because the former makes him appear dumber while the latter makes him look like a jerk. He just blurts things out in a blunt manner more so than George. They're still very alike, but George is a tiny bit more mature in dealing with his friends while Fred's thoughtlessness comes out in both his victims and those he cares about. He also has slightly more freckles.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It paints a picture of them as being incredibly bright - possibly the smartest of the Weasley siblings newlinechar  newlinechar I agree. For all of their inventions, they were incredibly smart. They just didn't put their intelligence into schoolwork, but rather other things such as the shop. Sure, the other Weasleys all got more O.W.L.S. but I honestly don't think any of them attributed to the war more than the twins, or perhaps *could have* attributed. The books don't really go much into how Fred and George deal with helping out outside those protective hats. That's a canon thing, right? The protective hats? It's not just a fanfiction invention?

Because if they make master sets cheaper, the EV becomes worth more than the price of selling a pack amd a large percentage of stores will just open packs to sell singles instead of selling the packs.  newlinechar  newlinechar There were hundreds of postsabout issues with stores abusing systems to steal Fatal Push promos.  newlinechar  newlinechar By making it more expensive the EV and MSRP are about equal so stores promote drafting it. It’s a hard balance.

Tbh they've both had some success outside the 10 position. Under Ancelotti at Madrid he rarely played with a 10 and James excelled that year. So its not like they are both confined to the 10.

Alright guys, from November and April surges, I recall all the new money entering the market all funnels into WEED first, maybe some of the easy-to-find LPs like APH, ACB and OGI, then the peripheral action happens. newlinechar  newlinechar -People who got in at $9-$12 take their 50% - 90%+ profits and diversify, they look around for other deals, more obscure companies, the hard to find/under the radar stuff. Companies that are relatively undervalued. In MY opinion, TRST is 1/3 what it should be. ACB hasn't benefited substantially from this run like APH and WEED. EMH still seems undervalued considering their massive plans with VFF. CMED is still completely under the radar but they suck at press releases (the last significant one was that they got a distribution deal with PharmaChoice, the 3rd (?) largest pharmacy group in Canada, and the first pharmacy deal with any LP). People might be wanting to get in on license plays (like we all did with SL), UMB is one, HVST is another. For Biotech plays, I think Inmed is one of the best (since CARA was such a let down) and so far looks like it may be forming a golden cross this week as well - Pharmaceutical companies will want synthetic CBDs because of the variation and inconsistency of naturally obtained CBDs. newlinechar  newlinechar -Also the people getting in on WEED specifically because they see the beverage industry making moves, will be lead to researching TNY ([which has ties to Cott Beverages](http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/tinley-reports-advisory-board-changes-cse-tny-2160931.htm), the 3rd largest soft drink company in the world)and Lexaria [(who was halted today because they were issued a patent in the USA for their DehydraTECH)](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/10/31/1171172/0/en/Lexaria-Bioscience-Receives-Groundbreaking-U-S-Patent-Allowance-for-its-DehydraTECH-Delivery-of-THC-NSAIDs-Nicotine-and-Vitamins.html).  newlinechar  newlinechar [Here is Ted Ohashi's article on the Lexaria patent](https://seekingalpha.com/instablog/9721001-ted-ohashi/5063969-u-s-patent-technology-thc-et-al-lifts-lexaria-much-higher-valuation-level) newlinechar  newlinechar -A new generation of bag holders may be forming, specifically at end of year (this was me when I entered at $12.50 last year and averaged down as it kept bleeding)....if people take massive profits or the stock shows any instability, it will cause panic selling, stop losses and thus tax-loss selling at a loss (There is a huge gap at 12.79, so the people buying in the $16.50-17 have a potential -25% loss to look forward to, risky stop losses are normally -20%, and conservative stop losses are normally -5%). Who the fuck knows what is gonna happen, but my target for re-entry cause I am a fucking idiot who sold at $13 is gonna be $12.79-$13.15. There is also a small gap at $9.48 &amp; $10.77 but I am not expecting those to close with the new developments. That would be rock bottom pricing at this point like $6.58 was in July. **which before that, everyone, and I mean eeeeveryone, was saying it would never go below $10 again**...sounds familiar? newlinechar  newlinechar Thoughts?

I've met lots of charismatics who would also sign on to *sola Scriptura*. And of course *sola Scriptura* doesn't preclude a multitude of interpretations - that's the point. The same method gives rise to mutually exclusive interpretations.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The bible. He was preaching a false Christ. 2 Corinthians 11:4 newlinechar  newlinechar Arius was reading the Bible. The Church as the authoritative interpreter was the one who condemned Arius.

Nobody is saying anything close to that. The argument is if you're comparing 2 teams with the same number of losses, who you beat (and by how much) matters more than who you lost to.

F to Texas. They were definitely a major and influential civ, but after being swept away by the Inuit all they could do is survive, until eventually they failed at that.

Australia is excellently placed to attack Vietnam, yes; but I'm more curious to see what Brazil does next.

Vampires: Imps are magic, so is thier flesh and blood. Some imps learned to use thier flesh as a tool, becoming vampires.

Your talking about solutions for a post-labour future that most likely will never occur as if it is a problem we need to deal with soon.

The Scharnhorst and Gneisenau (sister ships) both started with 9 guns in 3 turrets.  She arrived in Kiel after the channel dash where it she got massively damaged by the RAF (a bomb went through the deck and blew up the foreword magazine). The repairs were going to be so time consuming that the Germans decided to modify the ship so that it could have twin 380mm guns instead of the triple 280mm guns.  The original 280mm guns were taken out and sent to Norway and used as gun emplacements in the Atlantic wall.  In 1943 all work was stopped and I think it was used as a floating anti-aircraft battery.  In 1945 the Germans sank the Gnesenau in the entrance of the Polish port Gdynia to be used as a block ship.  It got broken apart and scrapped in 1951.

Regis
&gt; Yes, I meant the physical differences, which happens to be what we're talking about here. The James Damore case is totally different because that's about cognitive ability. newlinechar  newlinechar Obviously, I wasn't claiming that feminists believe that the physical difference are caused by socialization, but all the other differences - like preference for dolls, etc. This is inconsistent with any notion of transgenderism, as the boys will have been socialized as boys, and should therefore not be acting like a girl. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It doesn't make you a biological female, if that's what you were implying. Does it make you a woman? I don't think it's 'self-evident' that it doesn't if we define 'woman' and 'man' in terms of gender rather than sex. newlinechar  newlinechar It's self-evident in either case. If I follow female 'gender roles' for a day, does that make me a woman for a day. Of course not. What you actually believe is that someone's gender is determined by what he believes about his own gender. If he says he's a woman, he's a woman. If he changes his mind tomorrow, then he's not. It has nothing to do with 'gender roles' - aren't you the same people who oppose gender stereotyping and would vociferously object if someone were called less of a woman because she didn't follow the proper gender roles? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What, then, does make someone a woman, in your own words, separate from what makes someone a biological female? If your answer is 'nothing' then surely you must concede that you don't accept that 'gender' and 'sex' are different at all, yes? newlinechar  newlinechar Of course I don't, especially as it is used today. There are *gender roles* (and they're good, by the way), proper ways to act for men and women. I don't believe an individual has a 'gender' different from his sex, as if not fulfilling the proper gender roles makes you somehow not a woman. That's absurd. As stated earlier, I don't think this is even what your side believes. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; No, it's stupid because the only way your statement makes any sense is if we throw out the entire argument and pretend you're right. Maybe you think that, but it adds literally nothing to the conversation. newlinechar  newlinechar I thought you were saying: you're undermining your argument. But I often say things that don't help my argument at all, simply because I enjoy saying them.

Generally losing fat or gaining muscle are the big ones. Nutrition has little to do with either of these, although eating right is definitely a good step. Losing or gaining weight is a function of caloric intake. If you eat more than your body requires in a given day to move and survive, it will store the extra as fat or muscle. If you eat less, you'll lose fat or muscle. If you're working out and eating enough protein your body will favor putting on muscle and taking off fat.

Great answer. I'd also like to add that locking games into teleportation is more than a design choice. *Many* people get vertigo/nausea from hold-to-move locomotion. The problem is that it doesn't move you how your brain is expecting, with up/down and side-to-side motion that you get from naturally walking. For many people this incongruity makes their brain flip out. newlinechar  newlinechar Teleporting is a much easier movement mechanic for people to accept because we are all used to the idea of a jump cut from film. Pressing a button and being suddenly in a new place doesn't screw with people's balance/stomach. It is much more comfortable to newcomers and takes far less testing and refinement than full movement games take to develop.
Is that the one with the awesome stop motion video?
Wait, you interrupted the meeting to ask this woman if she was an alcoholic and you weren't chairing? Was it an open meeting?

Since I love co-op, I started specializing in PvE low-level builds immediately after my first run of Dark Souls. I've gone through both games multiple times at levels around 10, 20 and 50, and in DS1 I never touch vitality (whereas I put extra points in Bloodborne if I can, due to the massive damage-vit imbalance.) newlinechar  newlinechar For Souls games, it is true in general; while offensive stats go a long way, they only make a difference if planned wisely, and even then - due to soft caps - not many levels are needed.  newlinechar  newlinechar In Bloodborne, where weapons are absurdly enhanced by gems besides natural upgrading and scaling, BL can become irrelevant for an expert player, as long as they farm the right gems. It only starts to make a serious difference in depth 5 chalices, which the vast majority of players enter around level 120 anyway; and even there, figuring out the moveset of a boss leads to fairly easy no-hit fights where even Vit becomes irrelevant. I've opened and completed several FRC chalices of my own at level 4. newlinechar  newlinechar This, of course, doesn't mean leveling does not matter; it makes everything a lot more relaxed, it crushes bosses, and it is by far the wisest choice for players who enjoy spending multiple game cycles on the same build or running FRC chalices for exploration and fun. However, it is equally true that practice and blood gems combined can nullify the need for more BLs.

Correct, but I'd argue for most people (and certainly someone in OP's position) that threshold is never crossed assuming we're speaking in a purely monetary sense. Even if you're paid $50-100 an hour to work during your normal 9 to 5 your opportunity cost is not nearly as high during off hours, unless you have the option to and take advantage of working longer hours.

The amount of Islamophobia that you’re showing is incredible. I find it hilarious that you posted quotes taken directly out of context. If you weren’t trying to delude people into believing you, you would’ve mentioned that those exact quotes are for Muslims to follow **DURING A HOLY WAR**. Why’re you acting as if that’s everyday life? Who taught you these lies?  newlinechar  newlinechar Let me quote some quotes now.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;5:53, “… whoso kills a soul, unless it be for murder or for wreaking corruption in the land, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and he who saves a life, it shall be as if he had given life to all mankind.” newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;2:256,  “There is no compulsion in religion. The right way has become distinct from error.”  newlinechar  newlinechar Means that Muslims aren’t allowed to force their religion upon others. So your quote of the “forceful spreading of Islam” is a complete lie.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; “But if the enemies incline towards peace, do you also incline towards peace. And trust in God! For He is the one who hears and knows all things.” (8:61) The Quran chapter “The Cow,” 2:190, says, “Fight in the way of God against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo! God loveth not aggressors.” newlinechar  newlinechar You call the the prophet a “warlord” when you’re ignoring that to be an aggressor is a sin. As seen in the quote below.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; “But if the enemies incline towards peace, do you also incline towards peace. And trust in God! For He is the one who hears and knows all things.” (8:61) The Quran chapter “The Cow,” 2:190, says, “Fight in the way of God against those who fight against you, but begin not hostilities. Lo!

&gt;People have often compared them to bdsm dungeons newlinechar  newlinechar Who exactly? This seems like the oddest way to shoehorn in a Halloween related question ever. You'd probably have more luck posting something like this on a general questions sub but apart from this apparent comparison it has zero to do with BDSM.  newlinechar  newlinechar I went to one some years ago which was sort of okayish. Not really scary apart from if you consider jump scares to be scaring people. It was people dressed as a lot of horror icons, you had Freddy Kruger scraping his claws on these bars and trying to grab you from the other side of them, I remember there was a bedroom and the girl from the Exorcist is in the bed and starts doing all her stuff.  newlinechar  newlinechar The final part was this long corridor where you think you're coming to the end and a chainsaw starts then Leatherface bursts through the wall and chases you. They never made any serious contact beyond grabbing shoulders and these zombies under a grate grabbed legs and pulling you towards them or waving things in your face like knives.

My legs are like tree trunks so they don't run as cold as others, so YMMV.  newlinechar  newlinechar I like softshell pants a lot. I have a couple from Marmot that work okay.

I like my winter pants a little fitted since if they're too loose snow and cold air can come up from the bottom. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want a true winter pant I'd go with the OR Cirque since it's durable, affordable, and well featured for everything from hiking to skii-mountaineering. newlinechar  newlinechar For extra warmth and weather protection I'd get pants to go *over* the softshell.

If nerfs were solely based on popularity then Hera and Padme must be undertuned,even though they are 2 of the best rebel leaders (padme might actually be number 1), Anakin and luke should have been nerfed to the ground too (speaking only from popularity PoV). Krennic kallus too from empire. newlinechar  newlinechar The point I'm trying to make is simple. Either embrace the organic/tech (rock/scizzor) meta and introduce more support items (paper) for rebels NOW that will stop tech units similar to chopper ( buffing ray shield to 2 energy is a good start)or nerf the cards that support the At St like nerve gas. Adrenal needs to be looked too (yes,adrenal since nerve gas is what is keeping that and Anakin down). Then if At St is still an issue nerf it. Then if the hero remains an issue nerf him. newlinechar  newlinechar Why ruin a hero now because the meta suits him only for the meta to swap in 2 months for example, leaving him both nerfed and in an unfavourable meta?

To be fair, he isn't wrong. You predicated a lot on your *should*. This left room for one to assume pessimism - in which case there is no design compensating for the reduction in pie, as it were, and most definitely a bad thing.  newlinechar  newlinechar I think you may value intentions over implementations at times. That process requires a good bit patience and optimism; something which can be difficult given how bumpy Paragon's wild ride has been.  newlinechar  newlinechar I do have three immediate problems with your video.  newlinechar  newlinechar *  The high level skill differentiation is assured to be looked at for future increases.  newlinechar  newlinechar Speculation whilst an argument could be fairly easily made that they aren't strongly committed to that facet of the game. These differentials don't seem as common as streamlining/simplification changes. Some people are seeing a trend towards a particular design philosophy that isn't highly regarded in the PC gaming community.  newlinechar  newlinechar If Epic is seriously committed to exciting and meaningful higher level play(and the fraction of their playerbase therein) then they are doing a very poor job at communicating this to us.  newlinechar  newlinechar * The entire trends argument.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can't draw conclusions or logic from information so unreliable. I could nitpick through it all but you are aware of it being so - hence your warning that you were an unreliable orator on the topic.  newlinechar  newlinechar * Following those trends will make a good game, or more simply put: Being successful makes you a good game.  newlinechar  newlinechar While it is good for investors if Epic's development, using market trends, pulls in large player numbers, it doesn't make Paragon a good game. I know this is an opinionated take against all metrics we use to judge how 'good' a game is but I would rather them focus on a very tight and original product without sliding design around to whatever they can cash in on. Investors want growth, players want consistent entertainment; not always are those related. I think this can be pretty easily related back to why things have felt vision-less for some time after Legacy development ended. We were ready for an engrossing experience but the water seems shallower than we envisioned. The 'same-y' and 'brawler-like' feelings many get while playing now could be reflections of this homogenized trend chasing we see all too often.  newlinechar  newlinechar Probably more rambly than I'd like it to be but 'tis a response. Keep putting effort into the community and have a good one.

Some constructive criticism, not trying to hate on your vid. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with frag movies is that literally anyone can make them. Record enough kills, cut them down and add music; you've got a frag movie. It doesn't really make for particularly interesting watching, especially if a lot of your kills are just from holding angles. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're making frag movies, you have to showcase at least one of two things: amazing aim or exciting, dynamic plays. I'd urge you to watch a video from Noted or Beaulo, as they're not just clips of the actual kills strung together. Rather, they show longer clips, usually with multiple kills, that show off their superior aim and the crazy plays they manage to pull off. newlinechar  newlinechar It's all about context. You might get something from a shorter clip if you remember the fight yourself, but all we see are your crosshairs on some poor guy's head.

Depends on the tech in question. If there are benefits to it and it is being well-received, then it’s not absurd to say it is better. It may be ignorant to some extent, depending on the information out there, but not as absurd as simply saying it’s worse because it’s different.

You can't really trade on the PC.

If you drop it from your inventory after picking it up, they can then pick it up. newlinechar - Anyone not in game at the time you acquire loot is not eligible. You can drop it from your inventory, and they can see it, but they cannot pick it up. newlinechar - If you or someone else who is eligible for loot you have leaves the game or disconnects, they are not eligible for the loot. newlinechar - There is no trading interface, you simply drop the item on the ground and whoever is eligible for the loot may pick it up. newlinechar - If there is an item that you gave away, and either you or the person who took it leaves the game, you cannot pick that item up if they return and drop it.

I'm not a doctor, but your bones have cells called [osteoblasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoblast) that secrete new bone, and other cells called [osteoclasts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osteoclast) that absorb bone. Together, they remove and rebuild about 10% of your skeleton per year. This process, called remodeling, is how fractures heal, but it's also how microfractures that you get from ordinary activities heal.  If you killed everything you'd kill those, too, and the bone would get damaged and not repair itself anymore. Making a lattice that new bone can grow into would allow those bone remodeling cells to continue to do their jobs.

&gt; Same story as the last time they had a Cruiserweight division in the 00s and the Light Heavyweight division in the 90s/early 00s. newlinechar  newlinechar For some reason they LOVE the idea of a grounded mat based heel Cruiserweight with the title as opposed to flippy guys, so it becomes a midcard belt for guys who are small instead of a belt for flippy guys to showcase their moves. newlinechar  newlinechar Back in the original Cruiserweight days on Smackdown they LOVED the idea of Jamie Noble keeping the belt on him and beating a bunch of people cheaply like some sort of hillbilly mini JBL. newlinechar  newlinechar So instead of great matches you get decent matches with versatile people cut down to 10 minute matches and after a few months it's pretty much a dead title with no steam behind it.

Once again, quite correct.  However the standard is not you or I, it's society.  Society judges that killing someone because they use words is immoral, that killing children that are not respectful to their parents is immoral, that killing someone because of what they are is immoral.  Yet, that is exactly what the Bible commands.  Therefore the Bible is judged by society to be immoral and, as you correctly pointed out, neither you or my opinion has any bearing on that judgement.

You're analyzing it from a biased perspective. Both clone and freeze require very particular circumstances to work--therefore they both need to be pocket cards. It's not fair to look at clone from the perspective of your opponent knowing it's in your hand and freeze from the perspective of your opponent not knowing it's in your hand. newlinechar  newlinechar If we consider how they operate as pocket cards, both can sometimes be countered rather easily (after freeze, just drop something), and sometimes they can't be countered at that particular time. It was close for me, but Freeze is less flexible because of its increased cost, so that was my pick. We could debate about this on and on, and I'm open to changing my opinion with the right argument, but it doesn't change the point of the guide.
Surely we are playing more entertaining football than LVG and Moyes era? And also getting better results to back them up?

It's okay not to like **Friday**. Everyone likes different things. **Friday** didn't work for you or me, but maybe Sally and John loved it. That's fine. But whether you like or dislike a game, it is very helpful to consider *why* you do or don't like it (see below). newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, **Gloomhaven** MSRP is ~$100. The reprint should be hitting retail the end of this year/start of next year, so at the very least don't pay a gouger price right now. newlinechar  newlinechar But more importantly, I strongly recommend watching playthrough videos (rather than reviews) of **Gloomhaven** and all games you are interested in. These will give you a more clear sense of what the game is actually about, how the turns happen, what the actions are, and how the game play flows. Looking at these you can more easily judge, 'Yes, those game things look like something I would enjoy doing over and over for 2 hours' or 'No, that's not as interesting as I thought'. Reviews are not nearly as useful for this. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, this is where having a sense of the the games you like/disklike and the reasons for that is what you are comparing the playthrough videos to; For example, **GH** is an RPG, but the video shows a lot of card choosing/hand management and maybe you know that you don't like that as much because of game XYZ that you played. Or it shows you the tactical combat play is the main focus which you love because it's like that other game UVW that you enjoyed. And so on. newlinechar  newlinechar You were asking for Christmas list ideas, but long term you may want to acquire your own games as well. Math Trades can be a pretty decent way to build a collection; even if you don't have a ton of great games to offer up, you're allowed to offer gift cards. There are also BGG and reddit exchanges and auctions, the GeekMarket on BGG etc. [boardgameprices.com](https://boardgameprices.com) and [spielboy.com](http://spielboy.com) are great tools to check the prices for games your interested in periodically to get a sense of the average price. That way you'll know if the supposed ''sale'' is really a good deal or not etc.   newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Also, as a kindness to those who may view my Christmas list, I typically note a ''good'' price for a game just in case they go to Amazon at a bad time (stock is low) and see it listed for 3 x the normal price or something, they'll know to stay away.

Because the water that's on top of you is being supported by all of the other water that surrounds you, is the short answer. Basically, the water that surrounds you allows the top weight of water to compress you pretty much equally anywhere. That spreads out the pressure you feel, so there's no crushing. (It's also why water pressure increases as you go further down. There's more force acting on you -- the weight of the water -- but your surface area stays the same and so the pressure goes up.) newlinechar  newlinechar [This](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/archive/index.php/t-639088.html) is a pretty good explanation of why it matters where the pressure is applied.

I totally agree. It's hard imagine how much money so many parents have wasted blindly sending kids to expensive rehabs.  newlinechar  newlinechar The way I'm looking at it though is that if it were up to me to keep myself accountable, I'd be fucked. Literally digging my own grave. Drug court seems to specialize in accountability, it sounds an intensive pain in the ass, but on the other side of it is 18 months of sobriety. 18 months? That's a foreign concept to me. If that's what it takes to get sober time then that's what it takes, because nothing else has stopped me at this point. If you fuck up drug court you get the max sentence, which would be a very long time for me given my charges. If that couldn't keep me sober, then nothing will.

Oddly enough, an Exeggutor with Confusion apparently performs (marginally) better against Lapras than one with Bullet Seed. Looking at the details of fast moves, this is how I would try to make sense of this:  newlinechar  newlinechar Confusion deals 12.5 DPS and gains 9.38 EPS; Bullet Seed deals 7.27 DPS and gains 12.73 EPS. Multiplying Bullet Seed's damage by 1.4x for Super Effectiveness, you get 10.18 DPS. Does the 2.32 DPS difference outweigh the 3.35 EPS difference?  newlinechar  newlinechar Well, the deciding factor here is whether Bullet Seed can help you squeeze out another Solar Beam fast enough to make up the difference in fast attack damage. You'd need 100 Energy / 3.35 EPS = about 30 seconds in order for Bullet Seed to produce an extra Solar Beam under ideal conditions. Since a single Exeggutor is unlikely to last more than 30 seconds against a Lapras raid boss while all-out attacking, I suppose the extra DPS from Confusion wins out over Bullet Seed in the end.  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, my understanding of detailed battle mechanics is very limited, so I might've missed something!
I think everyone should agree that lives matter and nobody is automatically bad because of the color of their skin.

If they added skin color and material selection, we could basically make our own epic skins, also letting small teams and friends make their own coordinated uniforms without having to do anything official. Maybe that's why we haven't gotten any epics at all in the last 3 events (?), and it'd be a shame to see them go forever, but a system like this would be a really interesting substitute.

[Walter White voice] You’re goddamn right. I, too, could write a novel on the POTC movies! One of my favorite movie series of all time. The fourth movie *absolutely* suffered because they tried to make Jack the protagonist...when Jack works only as a deuteragonist. The reason the original trilogy was so good was because Will + Elizabeth was the protagonists; they were the lovable “outsiders” who the audience could connect with. Jack was the charming, rogueish cad who was amazing when fed to us in smaller doses.  newlinechar  newlinechar But when Jack moved from the deuteragonist role to the protagonist role in the fourth movie, what was once charming and sly and witty about him suddenly became overbearing and obnoxious. Turns out, there really *is* such a thing as too much Captain Jack Sparrow! Too much focus on made him hammy.  newlinechar  newlinechar This is why I think the fifth movie was much better recieved. They made Jack the deuteragonist again and that made him tolerable again. Although I would like to just gripe for a moment: I’m REALLY disappointed with what they’ve done with Jack’s character as of late. He was silly at times in the beginning of the franchise, but he was also cunning as hell, charming, smooth, and wickedly witty. Now they’ve just turned him into this bumbling, drunken fool who doesn’t make things happen—he lets things happen *to* him. You don’t get the feeling that he’s clever or charming anymore...just kind of silly and over-the-top. The whole point of Dead Men Tell No Tales was that he was drunk and lost in the beginning, but he had found purpose and hope again in the end—so I’m crossing my fingers and praying that he will make a return to the charming rogue he once was in the next movie! I miss the Captain Jack that I fell in love with at age 10 or whatever, you know?  newlinechar  newlinechar Sorry for the length lol. I have a lot of feelings about the POTC movies.

&gt;Yeah, it solved the Serbian issue, by destroying their separatist political entity. newlinechar  newlinechar Good, you admit it one way or another. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;They rose up because propaganda told them to. newlinechar Croats were absolutely in no position to do them harm in the early 90s, Croatia had neither military nor political capability, not even a fully functioning police force. newlinechar Had they not rose up, nothing would have happened. newlinechar  newlinechar There is no denying Belgrade propaganda played a big part. But your leadership did very little to combat this propaganda, in fact it only gave it more munition. Don´t deny this. Serbs were turned from a constituent people into a minority, which they last were (with the exception of WWII) in Austria-Hungary. Ustaše in emigration were allowed to return, and Tuđman and co. did not give of the feeling that they had good intentions. Which they did not have, they were no better than Slobo (or latter Alija). newlinechar  newlinechar Had they not risen up they´d be stuck living in a country they still feared with minority rights, separate from Serbia, something they ancestors fought to make sure wouldn´t be the case.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;But Croatia absolutely was the victim in the last war, just as it was the villain in the war before that one, the roles switched. newlinechar  newlinechar I don´t consider either side the victim in the last war. I do believe that you had the right to secede, but only if the Serbs in Croatia were also allowed to secede, that is stay with Yugoslavia. Otherwise it´s double standards.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar The number stayed consistent due to the fact that post war many were moved into the now deserted of those killed, also, NDH did include Bosnia, so many of the victims were from here, not the latter republic of Croatia. newlinechar  newlinechar Had they remained in the homes they would have certainly been subject to attacks, bullying, discrimination and quite possible ethnic cleansing anyways. newlinechar  newlinechar As for Z-4, it´s not as clear cut as you make it out to be. I do agree that rejecting it was a massive mistake, but don´t act like you guys wanted peace. It was clear that both Tuđman and Milošević despised the plan, just that Franjo reluctantly accepted it cause he knew Slobo wouldn´t. The Croatian public too wasn´t too happy with the plan. After this you carried out Op. Flash, attacking Krajina, despite the area being guarded by the UN. And when they asked you pull back you refused. You wanted the plan to fall through just as the Austrians wanted the ultimatum to fall through in 1914. Doesn´t excuse our actions, but please don´t act like you wanted a diplomatic solution. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;That is arguable, but the court decision is not. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course I can´t argue with the court but I can refuse to accept their decision. I doubt many of you people are too happy about Vojo getting released. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Dude, nobody outside Croatia and Serbia care now, even less will care in years time. newlinechar  newlinechar Again, read what I said before. One day, when the world order shifts away from the US and NATO, presumably to China and maybe Russia, that decision will be painted as something shameful the west made possible.

That's what I find interesting about McKamey Manor – the types of people it attracts compared to the types of people BDSM might attract. It mainly seems to amount to a difference in the dynamics of simulated torture, because McKamey completely does away with the sexual dynamics, and shifts the power dynamics from master/slave to straight up torturer/victim with no pretenses. newlinechar  newlinechar The strongest impression I get after watching what's on Youtube regarding McKamey Manor is that it was created by a narcissistic sociopath to torture idiots who think they have something to prove, and what perpetuates it is the exclusivity. [The application process alone](https://youtu.be/647y_ayqiMU?t=3m21s) makes it sound cult-like, and interestingly it reminds me of [another guy who developed a cult-like sense of exclusivity around himself this summer.](https://www.thechoeshow.com/)

If people like you ruin coffee by pushing some bullshit liability lawsuit crap that forces it to be brewed a lower temperature I swear to god you will get torn limb from limb by cranky coffee addicts who have not had their first cup.

Everyone who drinks coffee knows it is fucking hot. The temperature McDonalds served their coffee at is totally normal and no different than the coffee maker in your house. In fact you are likely to get it colder because they don't just brew tiny batches like you do at home they brew giant batches and put it in a insulated container.

I feel like you go by winrate in those scenarios.

We can practice harm reduction all we want but the fact of the matter is, because of their illegality and stigma, there just isn’t enough info out there and we end up being the guinea pigs.  newlinechar  newlinechar Adam makes a point to share his experiences but always says things like “Don’t do anything just because you saw it in a YouTube video” and “This is a story from my past, I’d never do this now” or “This was fucking stupid of me to do, don’t ever do this”.  newlinechar  newlinechar It’s what we are all doing on this sub.

He doesn't need to be gay. Trust me I'm gay myself. If they did that they would make a whole plot point about it. It does not matter. It's like saying please make X black.

Why is she a terrible friend? Because she didn't sit there and wallow in Barb's pity party?

Just like Jenelle, she doesn't take any accountability for why her relationship with her daughter is the way it is. Donna seemed like an honest person, which is better than an ass kissing enabler.

Interesting, and yeah Berkeley does seem to be hyper-liberal. Who konws, maybe my experience is skewed by my own perspective?

Agreed, decentralization is less efficient for production, but for there to be a breakthrough in public perception for nuclear power there has to be a higher degree of agency given to the people receiving that power. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, decentralization would incentivize the modular side of reactor design, pushing technology further down the road for miniaturization. newlinechar  newlinechar Give cities the ability to make their own decisions for nuclear power generation and the social inertia of larger governments can be bypassed.

US soldier versus private mercenary would be a good comparison but not strictly relevant to this discussion. Private school teacher vs public school teacher would be another interesting one. I went to private Catholic schools as a kid, and teachers admitted that they got paid less, but they also had to put up with way less shit from kids than they had to a public school. That doesn't work across the board though, because there are definitely private schools that pay teachers more than public schools.  newlinechar  newlinechar The question also needs to be asked about whether, if public workers are paid more, if public workers are fundamentally overpaid, or if private workers are underpaid.

I can appreciate what you are saying but I've seen the opposite occur at an alarming rate. CPS removes kids from homes where they don't really need to be and let's kids stay in the homes they really need to be taken from. I delivered a recliner to a man who had a 7 year old who lived in a crib. He wasn't being cared for mentally, physically nor emotionally. People spoke to him so little that he was completely non verbal and the other kids threw things at him all day. After a week of deliberation, I called CPS. That was 8 months ago and the kid is still there. I would have thought that alone would've warranted being removed. This is aside from bedbug and roach infestation, a trailer with no back door, holes in the floor, water leaks all over, no ac or heat.

Next time chop up a LOT of garlic. Add OLIVE OIL to a pan and then put in the garlic and also red pepper chili flakes at the same time.

The roasted garlic flavor with the olive oil is amazing especially after you top the garlic on the steak.
The title asked for an opinion, so I gave mine as a member of a marginalised minority community and stated that it was only my opinion when I said I ''personally'' felt that way. I am sure you can find people from my community who disagree with me, but as someone who was quite active in our cultural activities back when I lived closer, I can say that we've had a lot of talks about cultural appropriation and it is a very generalised belief that sharing things like names and food is a neutral to positive gesture as opposed to ones that we feel are harmful or disrespectful to us.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know that my opinion is representative of that of my community, but I am also very aware that we are one of several communities within our cultural group (and that there are other cultural groups with their own smaller communities) so I specifically and intentionally framed this as my own opinion.  newlinechar  newlinechar My community had its languages seen as inferior than those of colonisers and they were forced out of our cultures for lack of a better way of putting it and there are currently initiatives to reverse this and put value back in our language so to speak, and we tend to see sharing our language as a positive thing. I see why other people would feel differently, but again, that concern was not relevant to the opinion I offered because I thought it clear that I wasn't trying to speak for everyone.  newlinechar  newlinechar Hope this answers everything!

There was an Apache early in the 2nd Iraq conflict which was brought down by some kind of bad luck shot/oil pressure loss, but intact. Both pilots survived the controlled crash, however by the time coalition forces arrived the cockpit had been destroyed by small arms fire.  newlinechar  newlinechar Moral of the story is that although a single shot or two can be glanced off or otherwise absorbed by armor, sustained small arms to a localized area will defeat the glass. newlinechar  newlinechar When the Apache arrived back at a coalition base, they had the cockpit covered with a tarp, and guards posted too.

I don't know if any game does this, but to me, the best way to handle story in a fighting game would be to just have multiple short stories with different characters, and by that i don't mean the character story model of giving each character their own story some games do, but just making a bunch of different stories in the same game, that way you don't have to write a single big story where every single character has to get involved, and you also don't have to write a bunch of character stories that don't have anything interesting and/or contradict each other.

For clarification, the RBs I'm looking at are without a doubt worse than JuJu. However, I need depth at the RB position due to worry about CJ. As such, I'm looking for RBs that have been increasing in workload (Mack, Collins, etc.). The idea is, if I pick up someone who ends up being an RB2 by the end of the season and if CJ continues to concede carries to the other backs, then I'll have more options. 
Hubby and I have a diabetic cat.  We gave him insulin twice a day for months, then down to once a day, until finally he leveled out and we've been able to control his diabetes with a high protein diet instead of the shots.  That obviously isn't the case with all kitties, but once you get the hang of testing her blood sugar and administering the shots, you'll both do great!
The Avengers theme is fantastic. They just don't use it enough for it to stick in audiences' minds. There was a response to that video that outlined why that's the case. Elfman changed the Avengers theme for AoU, and it hasn't been used since. Wonder Woman's theme is probably more recognisable than the Avengers theme purely because they've used it multiple times. newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, Elfman needs to deliver the goods on a proper JL theme. Hell, I wouldn't care if it was just a rescore of the OG JL animated theme. That would be sick.

LEGO Batman made the affirmative claim this was illegal. As for unconscionablity and bargaining power, the circumstances of the bargaining are looked at rather that the result. I am perfectly free to offer you a priceless painting that’s been in my family for generations for $3.50 and the courts are not in the business of weighing consideration. Results don’t matter as much as negotiation or are you prepared to argue the result in [Peevyhouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peevyhouse_v._Garland_Coal_%26_Mining_Co.) wasn't grossly unfair.  To know whether this clause is unconscionable we would need the circumstances surrounding the negotiation.

tbf, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Kings. The playmaking is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of post moves most of the highlights will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also the fans' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Dragon Ball Z literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the team, to realise that they’re not just ball players- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Kings truly ARE idiots.

The easiest combos for both damage and force were viable at top level. A player could do literally the same thing over and over while just avoiding the other player the entire time (both insanely easy to do in high level). Same thing could be done in lower levels, so there was just a very small skill gap from low level to high level in lance.  newlinechar  newlinechar Most of the weapon is the same, but you have to learn more about what options you have to use in what situations instead of using the same thing over and over again, which disallows that sort of situation. Most of the combos are frame perfect as well, making it more difficult to pull off than just clicking a few buttons. newlinechar  newlinechar By no means is it the worst weapon; without sair, hammer is pretty much nothing. The only approaches it has is slight &amp; throw, it's only decent kills are sair and nair, dair puts your opponent at an advantage and resets to neutral instantly at later damages.

Not out of the realm of the ordinary for a pepper, it’s just that after a few days of not shoving sugar into my body my tastebuds got a little more sensitive to the natural sugars and I was actually able to taste it. After that I started to appreciate the taste of vegetables a lot more, whereas before they just tasted like bitter cellulose-water.  newlinechar  newlinechar TL; DR on the above is that your palate has to change before you start to really enjoy healthy food, so don’t get discouraged if it doesn’t happen right away. If you find yourself dreading meals because you hate all of the food, instead of going cold turkey off of “unhealthy” food, try making small modifications to start. Eat vegetables...with dip. Eat pizza...with a whole-wheat crust. Don’t expect to just start to like healthy food, and don’t get discouraged if you give in and have a Coke or some chips or whatever. Rome wasn’t built in a day, if you need to indulge in some “unhealthy” food at the beginning, don’t be too hard on yourself.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also, suddenly changing your diet may fuck with your digestion. Keep an eye out for bathrooms and keep some Kleenex in your pocket in case the bathroom you’re in is out of toilet paper. From experience, you do not want to be caught unawares. It will not be pretty.  newlinechar  newlinechar Also don’t feel too bad for not liking carrots. Carrots are gross even with a load of ranch dip on them.

Presumably sometimes it's the easier method, or it's a bunch of fat yokels afraid of the subway and a little exercise, or fed up New Yorkers, or people with shit to carry, or whatever, but your average tourist is probably looking to save money, and the MTA is cheap.  newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously, the subway is way easier, and faster than Uber or Lyft in Manhattan or even Brooklyn sometimes.

This is a legitimately interesting question. I think rationality suggests that while a high quantity of anecdotal reports certaintly increases plausibility, that discernment of truth has to take into account the totality of information. If the anecdotal reports contradict established verified science they must be treated with more skepticism and scrutiny and must be weighed against the know psychological explanations. Something like a religious mass delusion is fairly well understood for example. Falsifiabilty has been demonstrated to be a much better barometer for truth than consensus. The problem is that most people are not intamitely familiar with the mechanics of their own brain as a pattern producing machine (this is different from pattern detecting) and as a result have an unreasonable amount of confidence in the objectivity of their personal experiences and memories.

You shouldn't try adding spacers--only moving them from above the stem to below. newlinechar  newlinechar I would recommend getting an adjustable angle stem as a temporary tester, and playing with the angle to try different positions.

The Ritchey ones are actually quite nice and I would consider them acceptable as a permanent solution, but if you are planning on it just as a temporary thing you might want to cheap out on that.

Unless it is one of the best schools, then I do not think it is worth the transfer. CS kinda depend on the student more than school, you need to do you research, learn, and practice a lot. Because in any school you will only learn the basics, and most of the time pretty old stuff. Good luck.

anyone else think its a bit unfair with the heavy hitters, I mean ashley and laurel should at least be similar in strength/size. How do they choose who they went up against because i wouldnt want to face laurel if i had the option of going against someone like ashley. So far the boys seems similar but at least get emily and laurel who seem to have similar body frame.

You keep getting deeper in a hole. First you would have to decide how 'society' decides something. If Trump is elected President does that mean american society believes it's moral to destroy North Korea? Who knows?  newlinechar  newlinechar If morality is subjective whatever society chooses is right, using whatever definition of 'society' and 'chooses' one likes.  Why do you only focus on the Bible? If nazi germany decides to set up death camps and exterminate whole races, that meets your definition of morality. They chose to do it. If pagans sacrifice children to their Gods, that meets your definition of morality. That's what you are actually defending.  newlinechar  newlinechar That's not a definition of morality most people want to live with. Subjective morality is no moral standard at all.

Patrick is the friend of a friend who ended up at your party, then you found him still there on your couch the next morning, then wanted to go to breakfast, then wanted to hang out while you cleaned up, then wanted to play video games with your kids, then asked what was for dinner, and then walked around bored in the evening so he just kept doing backflips, and touching stuff, and moving things around, while you just kept dropping hints that it may be time to leave, and you've got work in the morning.

I suppose I feel that drugs will always be stigmatized when we do fuck up with them and take it too far or ignore information, and for drug use to be more accepted, we and the next generation need to behave better to be living proof that drugs can be enjoyed responsibly. I feel his platform on YouTube and the nature of videos themselves gives Adam a louder voice and a wider audience than we have here discussing the same issues, and that's why I'm maybe being a bit strict - he is an authority on the subject to many inexperienced users, he has an influence over people's lives. Even if he never intended to be. I hold him to a higher standard as a result. newlinechar  newlinechar It's nice that you enjoy his videos and I do respect that they take a lot of time and balls to make. I really do. Since we can't undo the past, I would actually like to see Adam address more the potential problems with drug use such as addiction, in the same way he is open about the joys of drugs. I feel he could give personal insight into that and it's definitely something that shouldn't be covered up when promoting drug use

And that's where /u/Estaban2 disagrees with you.
The way I described it wasn't actually Charlieplexing because I didn't use both pins. /u/entotheenth is mostly right that both LEDs might go on instead of off. It depends on if the sum of the two forward voltages of the LEDs is less than the voltage of the battery. For example, if the LEDs have a forward voltage of 1.8V each, then when both are in series, they'd need 3.6V to turn on, and a 3V coin cell wouldn't do it. If the forward voltage was 1.5V or lower, then it might turn both on. Also, since there are now two current limiting resistors in series, the LEDs would be even dimmer even if they were on. If you want to make sure that they both go off, you could also put a diode in there to drop the voltage of the battery and make sure that the supply is lower than the sum of the two forward voltages.
Just say PMS and let them figure it out
