Since they're longer, it'll push the bottom of the knuckle out giving me some more negative camber. The front is maxed out negative with the bolt, but still visibly positive. Still have a few things I could try like modifying strut bolt holes and stuff though, and my legacy spindles have ball joints and wheel bearings with less than 7k on them so I'll swap them over this weekend and play around with it some more.  I was just wondering if anyone has done it before since I heard STI arms are longer and bolt up (once the rear bushing is swapped?)

Lithium batteries should significantly outlast AGMs so over their lifetime they will actually cost less. newlinechar  newlinechar My lithium bank cost about $500 per 100Ah. You can't compare ratings directly because you can draw lithium batteries down to 20% without reducing their life cycles. Lead acid batteries can only go down to 50%. 310Ah of lead acid have 155Ah usable. That's 194Ah of lithium batteries, or about $1000. newlinechar  newlinechar Lithium charges tend to be more expensive too, so there's an additional cost there. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand why many people choose AGMs over lithium. If you don't have the budget for them or don't want to put in the extra effort it will require, AGMs make sense.

Tbh, I like seeing the #3 spot as much as the next diehard Saints fan but we havent really faced another team that has played well this season yet, with the exception of the Vikings, Pats and Panthers. Now, Minnesota and New England were early in the season when we were getting things rolling, and Week 3 was just a blowout, but I really have to say, the only way we can have #3 position and have other team's fans actually say the Saints are a legit team is when we face Buffalo who has been playing very well lately and Los Angeles in Week 12 who has I believe the best to one of the best offenses this year. If we beat both Buffalo and Los Angeles, I see us as the 2nd Best behind Philly and predict both New Orleans Vs. Philly in the NFC Championship game. Now, after Los Angeles we have 4/5 games that are conference games with 2/3 weeks being the Dirty Birds. I dont see Carolina beating us in the Dome this year mainly because of how the Bad Juju goes whenever we play Cam and the Panthers, and now that Kelvin Benjamin is gone, we only need to focus on stopping Funchess and Stewart. The Dirty Birds are still going to be big games even tho they are the defending NFC Champions. I have us winning 1 of those games tbh but if we do take Buffalo and LA, I see us winning the series. Now lets talk New York, every team every season goes through an upset game where they are the favorites big time, I can see either New York in Week 15 or Tampa in Week 17 as potential upsets. I dont see us losing both but one of them will be an upset.

In the show itself... Cooper, diane and Cole disappear from the sherif's station and end up in the boiler room at the great northern.  Coop says goodbye to the other two and enters into darkness where he's greeted by mike , the one armed man.  He ends up in the woods where he finds Laura on her way to meet Ronette and the others. He convinces her to go with him instead and takes her by the hand, leading her through the woods.  At some point though she disappears while he's leading her.  we then get a flashback to the original series, the very beginning. We see pete martell go fishing except instead of discovering Laura's body, we see him instead happily fishing.  So its when Coop is leading laura through the woods, having interrupted her on her way to her murder, that she gets pulled away or disappears and that's when the change happens.  we actually see the flashback to the original except she's not on the beach wrapped in plastic.

No, I completely get you, but take this. newlinechar  newlinechar A giant push coming at your tower. You have a little elixir but you know if you can get more time, you can stop that push with a Valk/heavy spell. You can't clone your towers, but freezing the push will come in handy while you finish off with your support. newlinechar  newlinechar Same with offense. Granted, you could clone the whole push and take a tower. But unless your opponent has no spells/heavies, it's not worth doing. Granted, it might work if your opponent runs like Golem or smth. But with the massive amount of tornadoes/exes, it's not worth the risk. newlinechar  newlinechar Freeze on the other hand might not be as versatile for its expensive elixir cost, but it's definitely far better at taking a tower quickly. Most people don't even see it coming, meaning that your Hog/win cond gets at least 2-3 shots off the tower before the opponent can react. True, it all depends on how you play the card. But in the long run, Freeze is more viable than Clone.

What you describe isn't rubberbanding.  Rubberbanding is the AI pace changing based on how you're doing in that race.  It's not the same as scaling to difficulty.  Horizon has true rubberbanding.  In Horizon, they can suddenly get several seconds faster to catch up if you're doing well, or slow way down if you fall behind.  FM7 doesn't do this.  Their pace is based on difficulty setting and that's basically it.  They don't care if you're five laps ahead or if you haven't moved since the race started and are five laps down.  I know because I monitor their lap pace and distance from me as the race progresses.

I recently got back in touch with my dad who I hadn't spoken to since he emigrated when I was about 7. I'm in a long term relationship and if all goes to plan, I plan on taking my future wife's name.

One of those women (Appel) is a white (now pinkish) person.  Their sun protection was inside the cockpit or under decks.

All I am saying is that I think parents should not feel guilty about bringing kids out to eat or socialize.

If you're not a goddamn creep the parents will appreciate and love it for their kids to talk to someone else.

Three if you hunt something that you can't use a rifle and a shotgun for. newlinechar  newlinechar Protip: in a survival situation having 1 gun and being a dead shot with it is far better than having 6 guns and 5 people who can barely hit the broad side of a barn.  newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Insight from a Navy pal: the 5 people may be so much more of a *liability* than an *asset* in said scenario, it might actually be better if they all hid and kept out of the way...versus trying to fight and shooting themselves, each other, an innocent person half a mile away when they miss or anything else besides their intended target.

The tax return story made sense to me. I realize that it didn't go anywhere, but it was extremely sought after for months since Trump was the first candidate in decades not to release his returns, and Maddow literally received it anonymously in her mailbox, so it was firsthand.

It actually depends on who made the map, and what software was used. I had to take a few GIS classes in college, and am actually GIS certified, so I know a good bit about mapmaking. If it's made with Esri's ArcGIS (which is more or less the industry standard), it will not by default. However, you can change the settings to allow for basically whatever format you want.

A bicycle is a luxury item, food is a necessity. This is very simple morality. I believe it is okay to steal food if you are hungry or your child/dependent is hungry, or to trade drugs for food if you are poor and have drugs which have value and someone else has food which has value. The person who steals the baby formula to trade for drugs likely knows the baby they are stealing the food for. Of all the things for people to steal or trade for drugs, baby formula is the one I have the least problem with, because ultimately an innocent baby who is likely in a horrible situation already is the benefactor.

I get the point you're trying to make, but birth control absolutely is mind altering. Formulations consist in one or more sex hormones, which we have abundant proof of how they can affect the way you think and behave. It's not like an extremely addictive psychoactive drug, but mental (and physical) effects are certainly there. I've no issue with contraception as a concept, it's just concerning how encouraged the use of hormonally active BC is and how some people would have no issue with it being given like candy, with no prescription or anything. We can't filter ethinylestradiol out of drinking water yet, as far as I know...

Amazing work by them. newlinechar  newlinechar Look at you with all your quoting and replies. Smells like a debate to me. Which I sparked \o/ newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, I know about all that history. Too bad those countries were too puny to handle their affairs themselves, so superpowers had to step in. If they made their countries stronger, they wouldn't be in that position. They had thousands of years to do it - yet we built Australia into a world class country much faster than they could.

I'm just getting into Warhammer 40K after not playing for a very, very, long time and I'm thinking of playing Necrons (with the assumption that a codex is coming soonish) and am toying with some lists myself. So with that in mind: newlinechar  newlinechar - Aren't you worried about the 10x Warrior squads getting focused down? Maybe one 10x squad per Ghost Ark, then go bigger?  newlinechar - Maybe a CCB (it got the Character keyword in a FAQ) instead of the Overlord? It would make your MWBD more mobile, give some more Gauss AP punch to the Stalker, and you could use it with a Warscythe to tackle enemy vehicles / characters. newlinechar - Other than the Ghost Ark, where's the speed? Certainly Scarabs, maybe another Ark, and maybe Wraiths / Praetorian Guards (and the CCB would help there too)? newlinechar - What about a wrinkle in the form of 5x (or more) Deathguard at 1000 pts? newlinechar - The list seems vulnerable to melee (the 'where's the speed' suggestions would help, along with Lychguard) and against heavy armour (the CCB would help a bit). newlinechar - Why no Tesla Immortals (horde control) or Scarabs (screening, objective grabbing, and melee)? newlinechar - Edit: There are also the ever popular Destroyer Squads (maybe with a Heavy), or Heavy Destroyer squads, that add speed and punch, but they seem to be bait for getting focused down (which may or may not be a good thing depending on what you want). newlinechar - Edit 2: At 1000 points it's been suggested in that you might not want the Battalion HQ. Both the Ark and the Cryptek help with re-animation so you might only want once source of that, and I've seen lists with just a source of MWBD at 1000 and no re-animation protocols / invulnerable help. That does free up a whack of points and make your list more flexible, at the expense of CP. newlinechar  newlinechar At a 1000 points I understand you have to pick and choose, so you can't do all of the above. 1500 gives you more room, but at any points level the Necrons seem to favour big unit size over diversity. My concerns with your list would be what happens if presented with tough vehicles and characters, what happens in melee, and maybe not presenting much in the way of speed or other wrinkles. That's only my $.02 and I'm a noob myself.
I believe when he gets hit by those warpy things that it effects his ability to gain speed

She cant withdraw consent by killing the baby.  newlinechar I will say though, that an argument like yours does work if you don't consider the fetus to have rights yet.  So I guess that's always gonna be the central debate.

See I think too many people underestimate the power of cost reduction in this deck. The question isn't is Kinjallis Caller better than Optec Huntmaster. The question is, is one or the other enough. My answer is no, no it's not. I prefer to run both. It makes a huge difference in getting the ramp going hard and fast so you can get straight into the dinos.   newlinechar  newlinechar I agree about Heroic Inetervention, that's why I've got em in my sideboard. Board wipes are a huge pain in the ass for creature decks and Heroic Intervention is really the only tool we have against them.   newlinechar  newlinechar I think the Ranging Raptors are actually really underestimated. Their ramp and deck thinning are just super strong. Even in the late game they are thinning out the deck to increase the chance of drawing dinos while increasing the ramp. Plus right now they are the only 3 drops besides Lifemasters Bestiary so not really having 3 drops would be a real problem for the tempo.   newlinechar    newlinechar Kinjalis Sunwing is one that I keep looking at and thinking about. At first I was just going to mainboard em, but then there are some very strong decks out there that run little to no creatures so I rethought that decision. Then I was thinking sideboard, but sideboard options need to have very specific decks they are meant to be used against and with my limited knowledge of the standard meta I wasn't able to come up with specific decks that it would be used against without doing lots of research. Can you think of specific deck that it would sideboard well against?   newlinechar  newlinechar What are the problem artifacts in the current meta that you think you need Abrade mainboarded to help with? I can't see how it would help with the gearhulks because their abilities happen when they etb and abrade can't help with that.

Will other upcoming mods, such as Apotheosis be added here as well? It's rumored to be twice the size of Solstheim, comparable in size to Bruma. Very different from these mods too.

I’m glad you are enjoying the Glossier so much! I’ve loved most of the things I have from them (lippy, balm, concealer, blush, cleanser and shower oil, I even liked the sample of their perfume that I received and most perfumes make me wheeze). I think the one thing of theirs that I’m not sure I love is the Generation G in Cake - I’m not sure I hate it either, but I’m not sure it has any effect at all on my lips, so I wonder if I’d have been better off trying a new flavour of balm.com instead (so far I’ve only had the rose one, because I adore rose scented things). But I love the Generation G in zip - it’s such a clever little lippy it manages to look natural and red at the same time. I was going to get it in Jam as my next lipstick, but I fell so hard for Fenty’s Sci Fi when I tried it on that I ended up buying it then and there so I should probably wait a bit before my next Glossier order...

I would be very cautious about the spokes, radial lace spokes don't take multi directional load very well, so with all your weight up top like on these bikepacking set ups there is a lot of extra force swinging around vs panniers where the weight rides lower and is stiffer and more secure.

Yeah I don't agree with that. They have a higher HP pool than the Humvee did, which means it takes more ballistic projectiles to destroy it (.50, 14.5mm, 30mm), they also dont die instantly to mines and IEDs unlike the humvee, and their higher profiles lets them see over objects better, giving the gunner a better vantage point and more opportunity to hull-down. newlinechar  newlinechar The trade-off is really only a larger target profile, and some other side effects of being bigger like being unable to squeeze through some gaps. The A-and B pillars are also thicker, but the humvee never had great visibility. newlinechar  newlinechar Maneuverability is pretty equal. I was driving one through the woods on First Light yesterday, and had no problem making it up the same hills I could have with the humvee.  newlinechar  newlinechar This being said, they're only a small upgrade to the humvee.

The argument given is that this will cause rich people to move to countries where taxes are lower, rather than have them pay more.

Wouldn't this be broken in mill decks? Any card that's going to mill upwards of 35 cards needs to be expensive. Also it would be very broken in EDH. Not sure if this card would be balanced.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand South Park. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of PC culture most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Randy’s nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they’re not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike South Park truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in Cartman’s existential catchphrase “Respect ma authoritah,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev’s Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Matt and Trey’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 newlinechar  newlinechar And yes, by the way, i DO have a South Park tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It’s for the ladies’ eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they’re within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

I read your other comment and recommend staying downtown at a hotel that doesn’t charge resort fees (google it for a list). That’ll shave off some of the $$$ compared to staying in the strip.  From there you can do shuttle easily since you don’t want to drive. Find a group and split the hotel.  newlinechar  newlinechar For flights, set a few price alerts now on apps like Kayak and Hopper but a quick search from DC show round trip is about $200 which doesn’t seem bad at all. That’s how much I’d pay from San Diego if I didn’t have extra Southwest points.  newlinechar  newlinechar My advice is to accept that EDC is an expensive event. If you can’t afford it, wait until you can. It is worth the money though. You can do plenty of things to stay budget friendly but ticket, hotel, and flights will add up. Hope this helps!
Fuck, I can’t believe you’ve done this.
At my school we had counseling services as well, and I was there for a while. I couldn't handle opening up to the counselor even though I knew I needed to. She recommended me visiting the psychiatrist for a med eval in order to make the sessions more worthwhile.

Don't be afraid to ask for help; if they see you're struggling they'll do something about it.

Wait, the game doesn't have Animus database? I probably won't play it anytime soon anyway, as I don't think my laptop can run anything post-Rogue, but it's still pretty disappointing. It always was a big thing for me - the fact you could get a decent length backstory of every major structure, place or character (or even stuff like events, customs), it had educational value (plus when I knew what's what I could do some further reading myself), it gave you much better immersion (since it made you feel those are not just some random places and characters made up from the game, but everything has its own history) and just made the world feel more complete. One of my biggest gripes with AC1 and Liberation is that they lacked Database - in AC1 it made you feel like you are in some generic RPG cities (maybe aside from Jerusalem because there were a few famous landmarks) and in Liberation you just got pictures and names of places without any text. I know there is this history tour mode coming, but that's like a separate game experience, they really should include normal database as well.

Hi! I’m a first year teacher who has been in the same boat as you (many days i still feel like i’m in it.)  It’ll get better, but not every day will be a wonderful day. For example, I have a really difficult high school class and they are disrespectful and unmotivated. Every day I tell myself “they’re my favorite class” to try and do reverse psychology on myself (some days it works and others it doesn’t.) I also keep a q-tip in my desk drawer, and after every period I take out the qtip and tell myself (quit taking it personally- qtip). Yes, kids can be mean but think about all the kids who you’re helping; that makes it all worth it. As you mentioned in your post, you had a student who asked a question and you answered it; kids like that make it worth it. You’re shaping the minds of the future everyday, and making the world a better place by teaching these students. :)

I have to say, it might be weird to start with a poem that rails against analyzing poems and then have them jump into analyzing poems. When I've taught poetry before, I've come at it from less of a formal analysis angle and more of a Socratic circle angle. What did you get from the poem, why, how does audience change the meaning... I also use the documentary Louder Than A Bomb and a lot of song lyrics in order to get their buy in.

Congrats so much, I'm just wondering, how did you find that help here? I haven't been very active, but I doubt I will be able to afford a therapist. newlinechar  newlinechar I pretty much have the same story as you, I got a job a week ago, after being jobless since frebuary.

It's like a fucking demon trying to whisper in your ear, and a wirldwind inside my brain, it's so awful, so, it won't be easy. Taking steps is easy, standing still is hard, but we must go on. We can't stop now. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar We have to fight even if we fail and lose some battles. The satisfaction of knowing we are trying, and that we're no longer depressed, that's a big change.

People for some reason have a blind allegiance.  BVS was not a good movie in any shape or form. Now that doesn’t mean you cant like it but lets be honest and acknowledge the problems.

We were robbed of amazing film by a studio and a team of director and writers who didn’t have a clear vision clear guidance and leadership and the end result was a horrible movie

I'm assuming that's joint legal custody. What about physical custody? Are you supposed to be getting parenting time? What's happening there? Does the decree state that you have to be notified if your ex-wife or child move? Are you paying child support based on the presumption that your ex-wife is supporting your daughter? newlinechar  newlinechar And what about educational decision making? Did she switch schools? Were you supposed to have input about that? newlinechar  newlinechar I know these are a lot of questions, but it's important to know whether they did, in fact, violate any of the custody order. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; It just feels like they are reinforcing my daughter's ideal that I'm not to be respected by castrating my role in her life.  newlinechar  newlinechar Parenting, not legal talk: she doesn't get to make the decision about how involved you are in her life. I have a teenager; she doesn't always want me to be active in her life. That's too bad. If you have joint custody and parenting time, *use it*.

No she isn’t seeking professional help. We have discussed this many times in the past.

Best punch I ever threw in the ring was a left hook. Wasn’t a punch I favoured, because I never really got much power into it. newlinechar  newlinechar However, my opponent on this occasion knew that I was a jab and straight man mostly (bit of bodywork if we got closer), so the hook caught him completely off guard. newlinechar  newlinechar Followed up a jab with the hook, the other guy was was expecting a double jab or even a straight right so his guard was away from his right temple. Hit him as sweetly as could be hoped, with some power behind it. newlinechar  newlinechar What felt so great about it (other than ringing his bell), was the timing and instinctiveness. It felt like I’d started throwing the hook almost before the jab had landed - foot stepping out, body squaring - I didn’t even recover my guard before throwing the hook, so the guy really didn’t see it at all. newlinechar  newlinechar God, I miss being in the ring. Too fat and unfit now (plus, I kind of got told to quit after a seizure).

Firstly: dont do bareback! It is super dangerous!! Please don't risk your health for nasty clients. Secondly, look at your local advertisements of sex workers and what they are charging.

I've been starting to zero in on a hunch that the Mercers are trying to prop up all this to clear a path for a huge upside with Rosneft.

If he's already a believer, you may not want to push this too hard. It's a difficult situation for a minor to be in when right now he should be focused on school. There are two things you can teach him about that will hopefully help him leave eventually. The first is critical thinking skills. The second is boundaries. Mormons talk a lot about agency, but then create an environment of high social pressure. He needs to know that he can interact with the church on his terms. He has the right to say no and he has the right to change his mind. Also, make sure he knows it is inappropriate for him to meet with an adult behind closed doors for an interview. If you're going to insist on anything, insist on this - either you or his mom needs to be there for any interviews. There are many cases of abuse that have made the news and you can probably create a very strong case for your side. Create a loving, supportive environment for him in your home. Make sure he knows he can talk to you about anything. Mormonism can decimate a person's self esteem, so make sure he knows how much you love him. Be there for him, no matter what.

Physical therapy. I finally did PT after years of back issues, lower back and hips, and I wish I had some it years earlier. You'll learn a variety of stretches and exercises targeted to whatever on you is weak and needs strengthening and then you just have to keep up with it on your own time. It's a bit of a commitment at first but I am 31 now and wish I had done it when I was 25. It's been over a year since I've had to take time off riding because my back seized and that is a huge development for me. I now know the signs for when I've been slacking on my PT and what to do to stop it from going too far. newlinechar  newlinechar I specifically had lower back issues brought on by problems with my piriformis muscles which is what puts pressure on your sciatic nerve and creates that pain. So you can at least start by looking up stretches for your piriformis. newlinechar  newlinechar I tried the chiro for awhile, PT is what helped me the most, by far.

We had a similar issue with our Aussie. She had a couple bouts with giardia when she was young and the emergency runny-poops never stopped.

The LHC doesn't send single particles around, they move clouds of particles in groups around.

This is the challenge. A restaurant can hire more employees, and give them fewer hours. But employees wages will decrease along with their hours. So how do you maintain wages while decreasing hours? Most places can't just double their prices. A large pizza costs around $20, most customers won't pay $40 no matter the quality, sustainability, mission statement. Personally I really like four, ten hour shifts. But that gives no overtime pay. I like what Magnus is doing here, but I don't know what the equivalent would be for casual dining restaurants.

I'm just confused to as why you couldn't is all. From talking with a few other people who have successfully tapered off, everyone who did it themselves had issues, they just kept working at getting the amount down as best as they could and eventually they quit, or quit and then relapsed months/years later. Which is the problem I keep having. I already know I do it because of stress and quitting adds stress, so I just get looped. The last time I tapered off and quit, I had an extremely hard time keeping to the schedule and I ended up slowing it way down, then tried to go down again, ended up going back up almost to where I started a few days later, then just quit completely. This worked for about two weeks until a friend wanted to go to the bar and I had one. It started all over again a few days later. Surprisingly, I had almost no withdrawal symptoms, probably because I was around 3-4 beers a day for about a week.

So, if I'm understanding this... newlinechar  newlinechar The whole argument is based on a team SHOULD get into the top flight based on their ability to beat other lower league teams? newlinechar  newlinechar I think being in MLS will draw more fans, that's undeniable, but I can't agree with bringing a team into the league just because they could beat other teams.  If FC Edmonton won their league, they'd still draw like 8-10k fans.  I don't want to see dog teams like that in the league.   newlinechar  newlinechar If Indy can support a team, with a big fan base, I think the league will be happy to let them in.  I don't love that the system is totally closed, but this argument that somehow promotion/relegation solves all problems I think is nuts.

In SoV, is there a better place than thebes to grind for, well, thebes. I finally managed to beat the floor 5 dragon (took me 6 attempts, each time I lost a unit to that fight), and when I finally beat it, it took all 8 of my turnwheels. I take this as a sign that I am NOT ready to progress to the 2nd half of thebes. So basically, anywhere better than the first 5 floors to grind? I don't have the DLC. I'm fairly certain the issue is just my unit levels.

The gas tax would effectively be higher for people who don't drive to work because they can't claim it on their taxes. Why should I pay more taxes for another persons lifestyle choices? newlinechar  newlinechar *edit: Wow, some people are really bad at math. I didn't use the best example above, so I'll break it down another way. newlinechar  newlinechar Let's say we have two people, Alice and Bob. Alice and Bob both pay the same amount of tax on gas, let's call it X%. If Alice is able to get a refund on some of her gas tax, it means she payed less tax. Alice pays underX%. Bob, on the other hand, is not able to get the same refund. That means he pays exactly X%. This means Bob pays more for gas. newlinechar  newlinechar The OP claiming gas on their refund means they are playing less gas tax than I am

When I was 11, [Joe Cole scored this goal at the World Cup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isuqe8IbYnQ). I was so amazed by it that when I played football with my friends, I'd try to recreate it at every opportunity because I really liked that goal. However, since Joe Cole was a professional footballer and in 2006, I was an 11 year old boy, all that ever happened was I would kick the ball high in the air and it would get stuck in a tree.

A talent was worth 60 silver mina or 6,000 drachmai. The pay of soldiers varied, and the rate at which Alexander's men were paid is not certain, but Diodoros (17.64.6) seems to suggest that a phalangite may have been paid the rather high rate of 3 drachmai a day, meaning that a talent could pay the wages of 5 such soldiers for a whole year (or that a soldier could hope to make about 12 mina in a year). If we decide not to lean on shaky interpretations of this Diodoros passage and assume instead that Alexander's men were paid the more common rate of 1 drachma a day, a talent could pay the yearly wages of 16 men. newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, the capture of 40,000 talents at Sardis would have put Alexander in the green for that year and the next.

A lot of things are unnecessary. Using Irish butter is unnecessary. Gruyere is unnecessary (swiss works just fine). Making a quiche this large is unnecessary; but I'd give sous vide bacon a try before knocking it.

Since trying it for the first time, I've been trying to incorporate it into other dishes besides just eating it plain for breakfast with eggs. You should really give it a try.

 Do you agree that an argument on whether there are two genders is way different than an argument on whether we should kill all the gays?

Very interesting post!  In addition it's interesting that the home belonging to Floyd and his wife is suddenly off the market.

&gt;If I recall correctly, most of the readings in my college Intro to Philosophy course were from American authors. Overall, there was a very strong analytic bent, to the exclusion of other branches of Western philosophy, and to the exclusion of most philosophy over 100 years old. newlinechar  newlinechar That was very far from the case in mine, which was more a broad survey of Western philosophy starting with Socrates (maybe a very brief focus on pre-Socratic philosophy.) If it had been more focused in that sense, then the exclusion of non-Western authors, or any non-modern authors, is reasonable.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  I appreciated the focus newlinechar  newlinechar Which is absolutely fine, but then you should take courses which focus on Western philosophy. The assumption shouldn't be that the standard philosophy course is Western.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If I study philosophy in a Western university, I generally expect to study Western philosophy newlinechar  newlinechar That seems silly. I studied political science at a Western university, but I certainly didn't expect that we would focus only on the West. When I study philosophy I expect to have access to, well, philosophy.

So, martial arts nerd chiming in... In Kali we teach, if you have a long weapon and I have a short one, I need to get inside your range. If you have a short weapon and I have a long one, I need to keep you at distance. If you have a long AND a short weapon, you're dangerous at every range.  It's also the hardest skills to teach. Way harder than two equal length weapons, because your hands do different things for different situations.  newlinechar  newlinechar Sword and buckler, by the way, is great. Lots of defense, and plenty of offense.  It's relatively easy to learn, And it's really handy to carry, unlike a real shield. 
I've done it and am happy with the choice. newlinechar  newlinechar I worked local TV, top 50 market, started in production, then topical producer then to creative services. Left that and did freelance and corporate post production for 3 years. Turned 30 and started to see the writing on the wall; I'd reached the ceiling on earnings and started to see that the level of post-production I was in is a young mans' game. newlinechar  newlinechar So, honestly on a whim, I started to learn AutoCAD. Took some classes at a local junior college, mostly for the networking, and it worked: I suddenly found myself more in demand than ever before. When I finally made the jump out of freelance, I sent out 10 resumes, had 7 interviews, and 6 offers, all with no actual work experience in the field. My background confused some employers, but others were into it, they thought my way of thinking could bring something different to the table. newlinechar  newlinechar At first I took a small cut in pay, but didn't take long to get back where I was with much more room to grow. newlinechar  newlinechar One year in, I work less, earn more (with room to grow), have full benefits and retirement, basically make my own hours, and am still pursued by other employers and recruiters. I miss the creative side, but found that drafting essentially scratched the same basic itch I got from post. newlinechar  newlinechar Your mileage may vary, but I don't regret the change. I've never been more optimistic about my future. I can elaborate on exactly what I did if you have any specific questions. newlinechar

One or two sessions is not going to work for anyone. It seems like your girlfriend is all excuses/talk and has no actual commitment or plans to get better. newlinechar  newlinechar Sure, start a new hobby, for yourself. This will not help your girlfriend or relationship though.

That is not a healthy relationship.

IZHMA / Saw Suit Anarchist and Contractor .308 / CR 805B ICTV Armourer. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;dodge sniper newlinechar  newlinechar [Build](http://pd2tools.com/l/db9a52b0a44f8fcf163d955a0790c991), Grom has 100 accuracy while ADS, but only 84 while hipfired so stay clear of that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;a general shotgun ICTV build newlinechar  newlinechar [Build](http://pd2tools.com/l/527f22020ed7f26214b0e0c79fbaf9b1) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;a stealth build with Raven newlinechar  newlinechar [Build](http://pd2tools.com/l/77e3096740e4107302aa407e1a00d6e7), you can use an unsuppressed weapon like an OVE9000 Saw or the Chimano 88 I left equipped to deal with civilians via Stockholm Syndrome on maps like GO Bank, Diamond Store or the Harvest &amp; Trustee Banks. newlinechar  newlinechar Any builds that don't already have Anarchist equipped above can have it swapped in without changing much, just drop Shock and Awe basic on builds that use it. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;What do the shotgun ammo types do newlinechar  newlinechar 000 Buckshot gives you a flat +15 damage boost, use this on all shotguns that aren't being used for a utility role.  newlinechar  newlinechar AP Slugs are able to penetrate shields and thin walls and give an accuracy boost which is important as it only fires a single pellet, and they also give the same +15 damage boost 000 does, this ammo type is useful if you only have a single shotgun and are using it to prime Overkill aced to give your other weapon a 75% damage boost. They also increase the range of your shotgun, but disable the shotgun pushing mechanic so don't use these in stealth. newlinechar  newlinechar Like AP slugs HE ammo only fires a single pellet, however it has an small explosion around the point of impact, these are great for dealing with shields on a backup utility shotgun like the Judge, for spamming during Swan Song, or for stripping the faceplates off of Bulldozers. newlinechar  newlinechar Dragon's Breath ammo reduces your base damage, but that is irrelevant as it ignites enemies hit by it within X distance, dealing 500 damage in 5 100 damage ticks over a period of 3.1s after the initial ignition. The pellets are able to penetrate shields and have a stun animation that prevents cops from shooting back at you as they try to put out the fire. These are the only shotgun ammo type that cannot be used with a suppressor, however the base damage isn't as important as the stun potential and DoT damage. newlinechar  newlinechar Flechette ammo has a -18 damage reduction when compared to 000 Buck, but attempts to make up for it with body armour penetration on heavy units and a greatly increased range, so while they will do less damage at point blank they will end up doing more damage in comparison to 000 at longer ranges. newlinechar  newlinechar Tl;dr on ammo types, when in doubt use 000. When using utility, if it is a low damage, high RoF option try Dragon's Breath, otherwise HE or Slugs are useful as well. Flechette is pretty mediocre overall, but is still usable if your shotgun already has a high enough base damage to clear the important [breakpoints](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=796195988) on your target difficulty. newlinechar  newlinechar

I'm not asking for that. I don't really mind religious politicians or people in general so long as they aren't using bigotry to 1) make fucked up policies that have no reason, and 2) manipulating those that are generally decent but a little ignorant into hate filled people. This has been *far* from the case, as history has shown, with religious government.  newlinechar  newlinechar And, absolutely I agree there are dangerous atheists out there. A lot of atheists on here are extremely bigoted, not going to even try denying that. I'm just talking about who's really holding power as of this moment. In the US, it's the religious right. You see people trying to justify their homophobia or trying to deny LGBTQ+ people rights by claiming they are Christian.  newlinechar  newlinechar Not all Christians are like that, and similarly not all men are rapists, not all white people are racists, we all know this. It's who's holding power in a system that is *extremely* biased. I'm finding it hard to disagree with your overall point, though. People who have these views to begin with and are charismatic enough will have influence and it's ultimately going to be detrimental to a *ton* of minority groups.

&gt; That isn't the argument I'm making. I'm saying it would constrained to local investment towards innovation because there is no incentive or way for surplus to move freely around the economy to a non-local project where it will be used more efficiently. newlinechar  newlinechar Why not? The incentive would of course be if it is deemed it to be more efficient. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Arbitrarily prioritizing local production is a bad idea because a non-local producer might have a comparative advantage in the given good. newlinechar  newlinechar What exactly would constitute a 'comparative advantage' of the same good in a market-less economy? In a market economy is would of course be a firm that would be capable of producing the same good for a lower price, but of course price wouldn't be a thing in a market-less economy. Even if a certain good were being sub-optimally produced in such an economy, which certainly should still be improved ASAP, there still wouldn't need to be any reason to affect the accessibility of the finished product.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;No it isn't, but in this case, it means that the production strategy cannot be adjusted in response to the rest of the economy. For example, two production methods might use different amounts of a given resource and how much that resource is useful elsewhere would determine which method of production would be more optimal. newlinechar  newlinechar If you can speculate this possibility, why couldn't this be considered and planned accordingly?

Today was the first day I got to wear my new sarb017. My parents recently returned from Japan and I asked them to pick up an Alpinist if they saw it. Luckily they did and I wore it to work today for the first time. I have always been hesitant about the sarb017 because of the green dial, and I wasn't sure how it'd look but boy was I wrong. It blends in well and is a dark enough shade that it doesn't call attention to itself. However, in the sun it really pops. I don't have a better description than that but tried to capture it in the second photo. The finishing on the case is excellent and the whole watch feels solid. I have noticed the inner compass bezel is a little loose and slides to the left so the N doesn't stay aligned with the 12.

And people like you will look for any excuse to blame immigrants for anything and it's completely irrelevant if they're at fault or not. I hope for you it's just that you've been taken for a mug and fallen for these scapegoating tactics rather than it being driven by hate. newlinechar  newlinechar Social housing was sold off and the councils were prevented from replacing it, making private rents go up and buy to let becoming a viable investment plan. This reduced the availability of the existing housing stock for the sales market, pushing those prices up. newlinechar  newlinechar It's more profitable for housebuilders to build fewer houses and sell them for a higher price than to flood the market, and for them to buy up and hold onto land without doing anything with it as there is no mechanism to discourage this behaviour. newlinechar  newlinechar It was politically convenient for the government to stoke a housing bubble so that the generation on the ladder at that time got an artificial boost in their capital and passed their gratitude for that onto said government. newlinechar  newlinechar None of the above has anything to do with immigrants. EU immigrants (the only actual mass immigration we've had to this country) are a net financial benefit - that means that they more than pay their way. If their presence has resulted in a negative effect on services or anything else within the government's control, that is the fault of mismanagement from the powers that be.

Yeah, the genius of Sparrow’s character in the first ones was that basically everyone (including the audience) mistakenly assumes that he’s a bumbling drunken fool who happens to get lucky every now and then. Norrington, Barbossa, and Beckett seem to consistently underestimate him. Then as things start to come together, you realize that he’s had a real plan this whole time and things are going the way he has wanted them to all along. It’s brilliant. Unfortunately, in the later films he’s become the bumbling fool people always thought he was. I want cunning, calculating Jack back! The flashback in Dead Men Tell No Tales is the best Jack we get in the whole movie. I really hope that they get it together for number 6. I’ve been majorly invested in these characters for like 13 yrs now.

If you watch the tournament rankings from week to week you'll find that several if not most of them win trade with each other. Even though they made it harder to win trade now, if you get to the Battlehall right as the week starts and you're the only ones there the system can only match you two together and if there's no one else on the leaderboard yet it's easy to get a top spot so that beating you is worth tonnes of points.

Ok, let's focus on cops.  To the best of my ability to google there are over 900,000 sworn law enforcement officers in the US and approx 1/3 of them are off on any given day which leaves approx 600,000 working the streets.  During their normal 8-10 hour shift the average officer will make contact with 1-5 people per hour, for the sake of argument we'll go with 3, so that means that the average officer would make contact with 30 people per day.  Multiply that by 600k and you get 18,000,000 law enforcement contacts with civilians every single day, add that up for the year and you get 6,570,000,000 (six Billion five hundred seventy million).  What that means is that during 6.5 Billion annual contacts with civilians, law enforcement officers wrongfully shoot and kill less than 500...out of 6.5 billion...less than 500...in a country with a population of 326,000,000.  Do you think that maybe you are being misled by an agenda instead of facts, and do you think it might be possible that this issue isn't as serious or as pressing as the media would like for you to believe?

How does it make economical sense to just phase out your entire army of perfect genetically bred clones because you won the a war, and now you're also trying to establish a new empire and build a massive moon sized space station that can destroy entire planets?

I can't remember where I read it, but it was the shifting of the role of the child in the family. newlinechar  newlinechar The child is now the center of the family. This was never the case in the rest of human history. The family did what it wanted on average (well, the patriarch) and the kids followed suit, typically seen but not heard except for introductions and such. newlinechar  newlinechar Frankly, kids are pretty fucking boring to most adults. They just don't have the depth of experience to converse meaningfully yet. They'll get there, but what are you seriously going to talk to a 5 year old about after 30 minutes? For some people, its not boring at all, and thats great, but its just not the case for most humans. newlinechar  newlinechar There's definitely a balancing act here (the wants of children should definitely not be fully ignored) but the amount of people who throw away their entire lives for their kids is a little odd these days. There's more to life than following the whims of children.

Reminds me of long ago, when LEGO had a small catalog of Star Wars models, and there was a large action image of all the ships together photoshopped in various places, and the X-Wing (the original one I think, set# 7140) had the wings all the way opened.

Yea it’s def possible I started traded when I was 17. (Real money start of 18) one year and a bunch of penny’s stocks later I started to jump into to forex. If your in the same situation as me I suggest you start saving now. Took me a year working as a server at a restaurant to build up the capital I have now for my forex account. And that’s just to get it going. I use TD Ameritrade because I’ve been with them for a while and I’m in biking distance of a local branch. Though I’m limited to 1:50 ratios. My tip on saving money is, not to compare yourself to other people. I have 4-5 different sweaters, 3 jeans and 2 nice shoes. Between that I don’t buy and articles of clothing. I see my peers in class spend ludicrous amounts of money on clothing and shoes. And if you are a  gamer stick to one or two games, try to get one without a monthly payment or micro transactions.  And this is just me speaking but the majority of SO ( in my case) are a high financial liability. Lot of “my friends did this we should too”. But that’s my situation. Find one that’s all for you. But that’s my life you could have something completely different. But the biggest advantage you have over many traders is your starting young. Take this time to learn and grow. Talk with other traders and learn from there mistakes and successes. “Birds of common feather, flock together.” Study one-two hours a day. Treat it like learn the piano(if that’s you).  I started from babypips, learned from a options trader, and through a demo account. Currently at 32% profits monthly from $2,600. But that story could change when I jump into the actually market. If you ever need assistance HMU. I’m on reddit every other day basically.

Nope that's just incorrect. We do have a Big 12 championship (started this year). In the case that OU wins out, it's likely it'll be OU vs ISU, aka a rematch. In the case both teams win out, our best win will be tOSU while your best win will be Miami. If we assume Miami wins out, ND has a loss and thus they're pretty much disqualified, and there's no issue with OU and Clemson. If Miami loses to ND, then tOSU will be a much stronger win for OU than Miami is for Clemson.    newlinechar    newlinechar Assuming Bama wins out, Auburn drops harshly from rankings and that's one less good win for y'all.   newlinechar    newlinechar All I'm saying is I'm confident OU will get into the playoffs. If the top 3 in the CFP right now are in and it's the battle for the 4th, OU's win against tOSU and rematch win over ISU makes it really hard to say no to them. But that scenerio is pretty unlikely since either UGA or Bama will *have* to lose at least 1 if not more games, and I'm confident ND will be upset eventually.

I don't disagree with you that some of his ideas gained popularity, or perhaps more accurately, popularized what was already the democrat's platform. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar You can't compare a vague poll during the primary to the general election, though. That's not even apples and oranges. It's more like comparing a carrot to a pencil. newlinechar  newlinechar Bernie would have been absolutely crushed in the general. As I said before, people wanted the racist, bully, high school jock with the hot girlfriend. And to his credit, Bernie was not that. The Koch and Murdoch empires would have repainted him as the atheist, ethnic jew who was lazy and wanted to give free stuff to liberal college students. They would have turned him into the elderly pajama boy. I'm not saying I agree with that. If Bernie had been in the general, I would have happily voted for him. Unfortunately, though, he wouldn't have been a viable candidate.

I think 99% of the “Stats” have no impact.  newlinechar  newlinechar And I’m not even sure that the stats aren’t relative - like when a 50 speed DT chases down a 99 speed WR from across the field- we know that the speed stats are either relative, or Pursuit uses Speed within a function, or it’s all BS and gets nerfed to hell and is meaningless.  newlinechar  newlinechar No one can explain why a 99 catch receiver will drop the ball 4 out of 4 times with no one close in coverage on a broken play. I’d get it if it’s once in a while, but it’s cyclical.  newlinechar  newlinechar Ever notice how 1 Out of Every 3 LvL drives is more difficult than the other 2? It’s the nerf that relegates stats to meaningless.  newlinechar  newlinechar I actually am at the point where I don’t think stats are even used at times. I’ve had 80 speed WRs outrun 99 speed DBs. Like what?  newlinechar  newlinechar Last year I used a gold QB and gold Olines on my themed teams till near end - and I lit up teams with passing, and those teams had OVRs exceeding mine by 20+ newlinechar  newlinechar No one can even explain this except by saying “stats get nerfed” which is really just another way of saving “**the stats don’t matter.**  newlinechar  newlinechar I’d love to see what it’s like if you actually got to use the stats shown. Is it not fun? Is it a lopsided? Is it a mess? Like why can’t we just have a “real stat” mode?

He's talking to all the disciples and in context it is regarding putting someone out of the church. And he had just finished discussing entering into the kingdom before that.  The binding and loosing and the keys are connected with bringing people into and out of the church.  That's what keys do.  They open doors and close them.  They bind and they loose.  This isn't some special office held by Peter.  That's just not supported by the text.

And to add to that she has it on the slide as well. newlinechar  newlinechar The thing about Grace is that it's 400 damage on a relatively low cooldown. That sounds ridiculous at first, but you have to understand there's falloff. It and Valor punishes clumping by allowing Lian to pump out rapid aoe damage in the form of Alacrity builds.  newlinechar  newlinechar That in and of itself is fine. She's getting rewarded for your team having bad positioning, In a 1 v 1 scenario if a Lian has subpar aim due to her low HP she's going to get melted with her 2k HP.  newlinechar  newlinechar Even with chronos 3 she's going to have a tough time getting off 2 graces against anyone with decent aim. Grace + Valor is 800 damage, which si nothing to write home about, lets say she hits a main fire, 1200 damage, okay, she hasn't killed anyone that wasn't already very weakened. newlinechar  newlinechar And she likely wont have Valor and Grace back in time to make for the fire fight. There's plenty to learn about Lian, I don't know what to tell you if you feel cheated by Lian when you die to her.  newlinechar  newlinechar Grace and Valor are overestimated, at longer than medium range she's not much to write home about either due to fall off, and Presence on a long cool down.  newlinechar  newlinechar Lian is objectively fairly balanced.

Cheers mate, appreciate it. I've tried many times to stop in all the time I've been smoking, this time I've had no anxiety, side effects or withdrawals. I know when I was offered the share, it was because the opportunity arose, and not doing it reinforced my desire and resolve to quit, so that occurrence won't happen again amongst my smoking mates, as they respect my decision that I've quit. Every time I had an urge two months ago, not having my dealers number took away any anxiety, it was quite easy saying to myself, you know you can't get any, and it was as simple as that. I think getting sick of that cycle, and not wanting to smoke, unless you don't have it, to only regret it when you do, is a great time to give anybody extra motivation. newlinechar  newlinechar Are you quitting or just researching?

Of course it's profitable to mine.

I used to work in a large Irish supermarket, they had rewards cards that would pay out money off coupons every two months. These coupons could be used on anything, you'd just get like a €5 off or €10 off your next shop. The rewards programme is very well known, so about 75-80% of our customers had one. Our managers had every new member of staff set up a rewards card for themselves and then let the staff take the points for those that didn't have a card. If you were caught not asking customers for their card on every transaction then you were gone. But those that played fair got that added bonus. Plus this is Ireland, not the US, so the customers who weren't members or didn't want to be members really don't mind that you scan your own card. Most customers think it's great.

Cutting and splicing into the vehicle wiring harness is a bad idea, plus the quality of any non-Honda remotes is going to be hit or miss. Same thing applies for aftermarket stereo or alarm. If you can get one with the correct wiring harness to plug into the vehicle without hacking anything that might be OK. But by the time you figure out the schematic, find an aftermarket unit that doesn’t suck, then do the whole solder/heatshrink wire hacking, you could just get the Honda part instead.

I’ve seen that you mentioned that you play paladin. newlinechar  newlinechar The general concept is basically, enough cooldowns so you won’t die and also allowing the healer some breathing space to keep you up. Keep in mind that tanking and healing is largely interconnected. Should you choose to not use a cooldown, a healer can spare you some by using theirs and giving you a larger shield. For example, scholar using largesse and giving you adloquim. However they might have a plan of using their cooldowns for other mechanics. Force them to blow a lustrate on you and they might not have another awtherflow to use sacred soil for mitigation on other things. In an ideal scenario you really want to communicate with your healers and co tank on how to best utilise all of your abilities to smoothen out the fight. newlinechar  newlinechar The next thing I want to talk about is your abilities and pairing. Big cooldowns can go on their own. Hallowed for example basically allows you to outright ignore the tankbuster. Since it is on such a Long cooldown, it’s use has to really be planned out. It is your most powerful cd and while you can save it for emergencies, it is far better to use it for a planned buster.   newlinechar Sentinel is also huge and can be used by itself.   newlinechar Rampart is a mid tier cooldown and will be nicer if you can pair it with something else such as convalescence.   newlinechar Bulwark isn’t reliable on its own so you mainly use it to build oath and soften auto attacks.   newlinechar Sheltron should be used as much as possible, oath gauge allowing. Don’t go blowing your oath gauge if you know a buster is coming.   newlinechar Anticipation and awareness are situational stuff. Can be useful in certain fights but mostly not required.   newlinechar Your other cooldown abilities are more team oriented rather than solo.   newlinechar Cover and intervention are cooldowns. Just used in a different way in which I’ll talk about more later. However you will use them on another person rather than yourself. Damage is still reduced hence the “cooldown”.   newlinechar Divine veil and passage of arms works in the same vein as well.   newlinechar The last cooldown you have is actually called SHIELD OATH. This stance is a permanent cooldown. newlinechar  newlinechar Now that we have gone through your abilities, what I want to next talk about is more important. It is called mitigation UPTIME. You want your cooldowns to last as Long as possible and cover as many things as possible. Paladin isn’t really very good at this but still decent. War takes the cake on this one. Consider your rampart duration and cooldown. It lasts for 20s and cooldowns for 90. This means that if you use it on cooldown, you have a 22% mitigation uptime. What if however your co tank swaps with you and used theirs? You now both have a combined mitigation uptime of 44%! Here’s where it gets better, both of you have more than just rampart. By staggering your abilities and only use enough you can actually soften damage for a very Long time. (This goes back to how tanking and healing is interconnected) keep in mind also range support abilities such as addle, front and palisade. newlinechar  newlinechar What to actually use will come with experience and planning for in which by only doing content will you learn.

Yeah they just kind of waited out the deaths of a lot of 9/11 first responders, and let their families go into bankruptcy over medical bills.

He will see more coverage, especially down the field (McCaffrey underneath a gazillion times a game), and the team already struggles there. Getting rid of a big target down the field doesn't exactly help everyone else's prospects at doing the same thing. And, as you'd think with all of these guys, if he was balling out and the staff saw him becoming THE guy, he would've been the guy already.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar I think he stays about the same. Some upside, but still could be a victim of the offense.

Good Morning? You mean Good Question?
Isn't it disgusting that's what happens all the time when you breathe?  Like, regardless of vaping you are constantly walking through other peoples dissipating cloud-breaths. 
This right here, calories in, calories out.  I've lost count of the number of times other people have tried to convince me that no, it's not as simple as that, sometimes there are medical issues.  Yes I agree there are some medical issues for some but you can't tell me that the main reason for majority of fat people out there is they have have medical issues.  Off the top of my head, I'll pick a number of say 20% of fat people have medical issues and I think I'm being generous with that figure. The rest just eat too damn much! newlinechar  newlinechar I don't see too many obese people in starving third world countries, I wonder if they wouldn't mind having the same medical issues that we have that causes us to gain weight even when eating very little.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's not rocket science, if you want to lose weight, eat less.  Don't even need to exercise, from my experience with weight loss, your diet will contribute about 90% towards weight loss. Do you want to eat that chocolate bar or run a few miles to work that chocolate bar off? I'd rather not eat that chocolate bar in the first place than spend an hour or two on the treadmill just to work it off. It boggled my mind when I first realised how much exercise you need to do to burn off calories.

I like the new timeout format, it made players have to push harder down the stretch.

I'm fine with having micro transactions in the game as long as the rewards are cosmetic. This is what I thought in D1 and it turned out well. However in D2 it's the only way to get cosmetics. I remember getting cool shaders from strikes and buying them from vendors after reaching certain ranks(eris, petra). But now all the cool shaders are in bright engrams, all the ships and sparrows are in bright engrams, all the emotes are in bright engrams, and even most of the ghost shells and some armor pieces are in bright engrams. There is nothing to grind for outside of bright engrams. Raid ship, sparrow, or ghost shell? Nope. Strike specific loot? Nope. Shaders from playlists? Nope. Ghost shells from activities? Nope. Want to earn exotic ornaments by using the weapons and reaching milestones with those weapons? Nope. Eververse holds 95% of the cosmetic gear in the game and the more you play the harder it is to earn bright engrams, pushing players to purchase silver. This is why I'm sure there will be a separate game for destiny 3, so they can sell us all of this shit all over again. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: the exp needed to obtain a bright engram caps out at around 60K.

The thing is, the questions were about the results of particular studies. There's no way to simply apply previously learned concepts to understand unique experimental results. 
your stats, macros age and weight are almost identical to me (although im on 1300cal, slightly less protein).. but we we are all different so take this with a grain of salt.. i stalled for a while.. then i cut out cheese and started to lose weight again. I think it was the culprit and my sleep was a bit crap too, it improved when i stopped cheese..  Also i did paleo a couple years ago and lost weight fast but this time on keto I am losing it slow. I have seen lots of similar posts about it being harder the second time around. just stick with it and your body will eventually get the hint. good luck!

I'm lucky I escaped with only a couple bruises and all my friends are here but definitely notice and am on edge when there's dangerous stuff happening around me. I notice it's especially heightened when someone else is driving, mostly because in LA everyone is on their phones and no one is paying attention. Not to mention half the people have no idea where they're going and act like the turn signals on their car don't exist. I won't pretend like I never text and drive but certainly I take context into consideration. Stop and go traffic not hitting 5 mph is significantly different than driving down the PCH at 5 pm with narrow lanes going 40. Texting and driving then would make me shit my pants.

The difference is the ancap rules provide the most freedom. The only thing we ask is you respect property rights and only in areas owned by people who want their property respected.

What camera view would you prefer? newlinechar  newlinechar Try to visualize if that would even make sense in a game like this? newlinechar  newlinechar The reason the camera is the way it is is because you need to see what type surface your wheels are in contact with so you can better judge how to steer, at what speed, and which gear to use. newlinechar  newlinechar This is not a racing game, it's a tactical manoeuvring simulator.  newlinechar The fun lies in the challenge of getting from point A to point B in whichever way you choose. newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for buying the game anyway.

Tangible points that will help the further development of a camera mode you would want to see. Mention similar games that do it better.

How exactly do you propose to counter not being able to hit someone because they’re moving so fast hit registration gets broken? 
Correct. But there is a limited supply of Bitcoin, so it has value by virtue of being finite (this does not mean it has *intrinsic* value, but people will argue the semantics). The Fed can **and does** print literally millions of new bills a day. They're not backed by anything. They manipulate the value to their own ends. They prosecute people that try to use anything else as currency (see Liberty Dollars [not that I support Liberty Dollars *at all*, but I don't support the way they were treated]).

They are on the high-end of USL loses but still we're comparing losing $2 million to $5 million.

To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Indiana Pavers. The work ethic is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the intricacies of basketball will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also Lance’s unhinged playing style, which is deftly woven into his characterisation- his personal philosophy draws heavily from Paving literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the Pavers, to realise that they’re not just entertaining- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Pavers truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn’t appreciate, for instance, the humour in the catchphrase “PAVERS PAVE TO THE PAVE,” which itself is a cryptic reference to Sun Tzu’s Chinese epic The Art Of War.. I’m smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Kevin Pritchard’s genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens.

I think some of our secondary depth should be returning this week actually, we might be a little short depending on how Nicholson and McClure progess, but that isn't our thinnest area. The issue is that our trenches are beyond depleted. We won't have our 2 best D linemen, Allen and Ioannidis, we are also missing one of our inside backers, Mason Foster. Our biggest weakness is between the tackles, if the run game gets going it will probably never stop. I think Wilson's ability to elude pressure and stay on his feet will play a big role as a depleted pass rush runs out of gas late in the game. newlinechar  newlinechar As for offense, the skins are losing linemen weekly. I can't really speculate as to who will be out there on Sunday. All 5 starting linemen are hurt right now. Add to that our back up tackle had surgery a couple of weeks ago and our 3rd string tackle got hurt on Sunday forcing a rookie guard to take over at LT. newlinechar  newlinechar The Redskins' identity was built around their physicality in the trenches, but that is all but gone now. With a patchwork line on both sides for the Redskins I don't see this being a very even contest.

The amount of co2 offset by the car over its lifetime varies based on the power source, but in Europe EVs emit an average of 50% fewer emissions over the vehicle's lifetime relative to diesel.

you were a heavy drug and alcohol user at the age of 12?  With a month free of this abuse?  I suspect that you don't know what hygiene really is all about.

As /u/Khaemwaset has noted Coptic is the only surviving dialect of Egyptian, however Egyptian is itself a part of the Afro-Asiatic language family, with Afro-Asiatic languages being spoken in parts of North Africa, East Africa, the Sahel region of Africa, West Africa and the Middle East today. Other surviving branches of Afro-Asiatic languages include Berber languages (which you mention), Semitic languages (like modern Arabic), Cushitic languages (like Oromo or Somali) and others. It is a very robust and widely spoken language family although it is quite varied (which is to be expected!)

With reading, it's best to drill passages so that the formula the SAT uses becomes more obvious. I know that may sound, pardon the redundancy, *obvious* to you, but it really is the best approach.  newlinechar  newlinechar If the issue is time, make sure you're just skimming the passages. Reading into every detail will force you to soak in a lot of unneeded information which may even hurt you when you go to answer the questions and face the SAT's tricks (like making a wrong answer something you read in the passage). What you could do is put two-words next to each paragraph summarizing its contents, thus helping you with questions that ask for explicit information from the passage. newlinechar  newlinechar Secondly, you could underline key words that evoke something: emotion, characterization, etc which will help you better understand the analytical questions that ask for an authors purpose in using a certain section.  newlinechar  newlinechar Thirdly, writing is certainly the easier alternative if you're looking to perfect your score to &gt;1500. Unless your writing is already at a perfect/near-perfect, and it very well may be, you could also work on honing that skill in order to increase your composite score by 10-30 points, depending on the improvement. newlinechar  newlinechar Otherwise, just keep drilling and studying. You likely know this but, just to reiterate, make sure you are understanding every mistake you are making to ensure you learn from it. When people utilize this strategy, they tend to forget it applies to more than just mathematical concepts. It can apply to reading as well. newlinechar  newlinechar On a smaller note, you may find some usefulness out of memorizing a small amount of commonly used vocabulary words.

Yeah. Just reading the conversation about hero balance today has me wanting more game developers to actually discuss balance with the community. And before anyone gets on my case about toxicity pushing devs away, the Overwatch community is not immune to toxicity, and has its own vitriol among forum users, but the developers still discuss these present and future changes with the community. 
I have, and no.

Fair enough. And with their heightened abilities, they'd probably be able to dodge majority of Stand abilities. Once again, my imagination isn't good enough to come up with how the fight would go down, but I would assume that there would be more casualties. I can't imagine a smarter vampire like Dio and the Pillarmen not take Stand abilities into account when facing any humans, for that matter. Especially since you can't really tell who has a Stand ability or not. It evens out the playing field between humans and vampires quite a bit.

JT Barrett is a good QB but a lot of competent QBs could do what he did with the same amount of time to throw the ball.

I think it can go both ways. I've seen people automatically dismiss something LGBT because they assumed it would be garbage. I've also seen people praise an LGBT work because it was LGBT and the work struggled to reach middle-grade levels of competence on a regular basis. This is why I don't prominently label or advertise stuff I make as LGBT. Too much baggage with identity. That also results in some people being deeply offended that they weren't 'warned' there would be a dreaded gay somewhere in the story, which is just hilarious every time. LGBT is spooky!

Yes! I was just in awe that as a 24 year old when we got married he had no idea how to do basic life skills. I'm talking cooking, cleaning, online bill pay, insurance, anything to do with school, how to write a resumé for a job, etc. I fully believe she did this to allow him to always be dependent on her in some way. Luckily, I'm starting to grow a spine (I'm usually a very kind, giving person, but she only takes advantage of it), and he's starting to realize that families don't work the way his does. We live near my family, and any time we eat dinner with them or anything, they always make sure he can eat every single thing on the table. All of them. My great grandma even made homemade gluten free biscuits because he made an offhanded comment about how he missed eating biscuits and gravy. Nobody makes him feel bad for not being able to eat things, or not knowing how to do things, but encourage him and teach him so that he'll know for the next time. It's sad, but moving 6 hours away from her was the best thing we could've done for him and for our marriage.

I actually didn’t vote for trump. But it shows stupidity when you bring up something like who someone voted for as a way to show how bad a person is...when it has absolutely nothing to do about anything. It proves only one thing, how stupid people are.

That could work, but at the same time, it seems like an unnecessarily high-risk move. Russian government officials know about American politics and culture what we do – which is that a good 35% or so of the American simply does not care about the collusion of their government. Their guy won, and they’re A.) too proud to admit they were duped and/or B.) hate the other side so much that they’d welcome foreign espionage in our elections so long as they were the beneficiaries.  newlinechar  newlinechar The longer this plays out, the more divisive it is and the better it is for the Russians. The Manafort and Gates indictments aren’t the end product of the Special Counsel’s investigation, but only the beginning. The investigation and potential subsequent trials could last for years. By the end, a good two-thirds or so of the American people may be ready to hang these traitors. That said, there will still be that one-third or so that will actively side with a geopolitical adversary of the United States so long as it suits their interests. What could better achieve division than that? newlinechar

I could've worded that better. If you don't pick up any items you will not get any of the points that are awarded for surviving (called rank points). You get points for hitting people proportionate to the damage dealt (hit points) and 20 points for each person you deal the finishing blow to (kill points?). You can end up hitting and killing someone or multiple people, but die without picking up any items which leaves you with no rank points.
Which is exactly how many you start with, fyi.

Not only do I remember the onyx sword, I remember importing my late game save with that sword into new games on the higher difficulties. Damn that game could be hard, near impossible on the expert difficulty, even with the onyx sword. newlinechar  newlinechar Recently I tried to play through again but my game kept freezing up in the last zone (the tower). Was so disappointing. newlinechar  newlinechar Also did you ever get a chance to play the secret character? Felt so badass but the fact that it locked you into using a set of daggers (I think they were daggers at least) and you were unable to switch weapons was a let down.
I think they meant one or two plays behind. What I find most confusing about haters like OP is that they are almost always the same people that are super upset about Mike and Mike. When I read most of their complaints, it makes me wonder if they even remember what Mike and Mike broadcasts were like. I love Mike Rice, but he would spew drunken gibberish DURING game play. You're worried about one play? He would derail Mike B all the fucking time. Rice didn't bother to even try to pronounce names correctly.  newlinechar  newlinechar I just can't stand the hypocrisy of it.

&gt;Coming from Quebec, I have to say we've made a ton of money selling power to Ontario and the north east USA. newlinechar  newlinechar I've read in other debates about Site C that you can only sell that power for less than it costs to create, but I have no idea if that's true or not. Someone else once mentioned that Ontario tried to do the same and ended up losing a bunch of money, which is why they have some of the highest hydro bill rates in the country. newlinechar  newlinechar That would be an economic argument against the project, I wouldn't want to see the working class of BC suffer hydro rate hikes, but if we could actually sell the excess power for a profit then that would make that point moot. I don't have enough knowledge on the economics of that subject to make a judgement though.

This isn't even about conflicting opinions. People who placate children and bend over backwards to appease them are in the wrong. Full stop. Not only is it bad for the parents, but it's probably even worse on kids.  newlinechar  newlinechar Some things have two sides. Or many sides. Most things do, in fact.

Not a big Harris guy, love Rand though. The wiki article you provided was interesting and did answer my questions as to whether there was any written language in non-Egyptian Africa.

Either way it’s a pretty color on you :) I think you might be over-analyzing it- I do that with my own hair. Anyway, disclaimer: I am by no means a professional, I only have my own hair dye escapades (and late nights spent googling hair dying) as reference. Someone correct me if I’m wrong but I think that a remover would lighten your base hair color which would be similar to what bleach does. I think it would work and bring you to a point where you can add “fresh” color over it but would probably be pretty damaging I think if it were me I’d opt for putting a similarly colored semi-permanent on top of what you have before trying to strip the color with removers. Semi-permanent dyes (manic panic, Adore, Lime Crime come to mind) don’t harm your hair very much as far as I know.

The seat bag hasn't swayed noticeably in the month or so I've been commuting with it.

Depends on how you define smart. I think non-psychopaths tend to think being evil is not smart because it only benefits the evil person while doing a great deal of harm in general.

 No it doesn't.

That’s what I was thinking too. Engraving also might work as the inks used are quite liquidy as is(and OP’s ink might work in that process). I’ve used a really liquidy glow-in-the-dark ink on a Heidelberg cylinder before but had to put all 4 form rollers in the press to get a solid film as the viscosity makes it run thin(with oil based printing inks, 1-2 rollers will ink the form up fine.) That’s the best waterless solution I can come up with as well and I don’t see anyone ruining their machine testing it out. If OP’s ink needs heat to set, a pass through a thermography tunnel after printing might do the trick.

I rewatched every offensive snap of the 1st half, no clear hit to the head of Kendrick except a solid head butt from Chandler (actually may have been this) after the 1st TD. Maybe a bit of a hit on the second play of the game, but hard to tell. Could have been before the game I guess.  Kendrick was pulled on the last drive after giving up a sack (he looked gassed and was consistantly giving ground).  Nowhere did I see him get his bell rung, but it's hard to tell on video. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Found what I think may be it.  3rd quarter 1:06 left, Kendrick takes a hit to the helmet and appears briefly dazed.

I don't like either character but what Will said was terribly wrong and inconsiderate in regards to her family. Personally I saw it as an emotional reaction to been accused of stealing food after doing a good gesture and providing food, Shirin instigated this by making that comment and Will blew up and took it to extremes. Extrinsically from what I have heard from others as well as listening to Shirin herself I truly don't believe she's a very pleasant person and was on the outs in WA. The issue I had with the situation on top of what Will said was that no one stepped in to ease or mitigate the situation other than Mike and this was really just supporting Will's behaviour.

Therefore, our objective was to evaluate the white-tailed deer mating system under QDM through paternity analysis. Using 8 microsatellite loci and tissue samples harvested from hunter-killed deer at Chesapeake Farms in Chestertown, Maryland, we evaluated 731 deer. The ≥3.5 age class dominated mating at Chesapeake Farms, with 41% of paternity. **However, together, the 1.5- and 2.5-year-old age classes accounted for more than half of paternity (59%).** No evidence of polyandry was detected. Our results indicate the interaction between the sex ratio and age structure, fostered by strategies that balance the sex ratio and extend the male age structure, facilitate breeding by younger males. These results indicate management strategies that employ QDM practices with a goal of propagating the genes of dominant males may fall short, and the interplay among sex ratio, age structure, and dominance relationships may be the main influences of mating success. Managers should account for these findings when setting expectations for reproduction under restricted harvest. © 2016 The Wildlife Society. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If 59% of young male bucks are the sons of the big rack bucks that are taken they will grow and become the large bucks.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

When things like smart phones and flat panel tv's made their way into the show it just felt off. Homer and Marge own mid-80's cars, in 2017. But if they were to drive more modern cars, it would again just feel off. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Then there's the flashback episodes where they continually retconned everything. A lot of first saw the show when we were Lisa's age, then Bart's age. Soon we'll be Homer and Marge's age, and there'll be a flashback episode of them in college where all the movies and music are from the late 90's/early 2000's. It's just depressing man.

Your last paragraph basically sums up my preference for 3 DPS in the lower ranks. With 2 DPS, if one of them is not on point, you only have one left, and unless he's a smurf/booster, you can't rely on just one DPS and your two lower-tier tanks to make plays consistently. Thus, with 3 DPS, you have a better chance of having 2 DPS doing work. newlinechar  newlinechar Also, since more people are comfortable with DPS over tanks, I rather put the genuine tank main on a main tank, and have the reluctant tank player to his/her preferred DPS main :) newlinechar  newlinechar Thanks for reading and sharing your thoughts btw!

The surgical part is they directed much of their specific efforts at the exact districts of the exact states needed to tip the election. All this time people have been saying it is impossible to hack the elections because of the diversity of different systems and complexity of all the political districts. But the reality is, if you *know* in advance exactly which districts are on the edge and can be flipped - whole elections can boil down to a dozen districts which can be targeted with fairly small resources. The mystery is that somehow it appears Russia did a very good job of this targeting. The biggest question is - did they figure it out themselves or were they coached by the Trump campaign who would *definitely* have knowledge of it.

Nah, but really, what's in them? Any guesses?
Technically the war started because SC and other Deep South states seceded, Lincoln called on the militia to invade them, and the upper South states joined the CSA, sparking a military conflict. But that's probably not what you're looking for.  newlinechar  newlinechar I wouldn't say 100%. Before in the 1820s SC actually threatened to secede not over slavery, but over a new tariff that was being proposed by Northern congressmen as the Southern economy was reliant on foreign trade and that tariff would have severely hurt the Southern economy while helping Northern businesses out a lot. So tensions had definitely been growing for a long time, and ultimately one big reason the South eventually pulled the plug was because the two halves were just so economically, politically, and socially different that the idea of inevitable subjugation to the other side was inconceivable. If you look at the historical compromises before the CW you can see that even power distribution in Congress was a key factor to maintaining peace, and in deed it is one of the reasons why the Mexican War was as opposed as it was and the new territory we gained so hotly contested - imagine all those new Northern or Southern states that could decide the path of the country for a decade or more. Eventually the North's population just surpassed the South's by too large a degree, and too many Northern states were being added to satisfy the South. Honestly if I could point to the largest immediate cause of the SC secession it would be fear of political isolation and disenfranchisement.  newlinechar  newlinechar Now, slavery was a long term issue, but it wasn't because the South had slaves they seceded. They seceded because they felt that the North would gain an uncontestable power over the government that could then be used to dictate the way of life of the Southern states and, yes, slavery too.

You could look into transitioning to a good pellet?

does not particularly matter for the combustion process no, but for oil and coolant and fuel delivery it does.

I'm sure these trucks are designed to get around this somehow.

The Buu arc wasn't all about Gohan because the arc was about finding the protector of Earth because Gohan wasn't able to do it. That's why they emphasized Goten and Trunks so much and then they pushed Gohan for a bit and ultimately went with Goku as the protector of Earth. The Buu arc was also Vegeta's big redemption arc.  newlinechar  newlinechar They also explain why Gohan didn't defeat Buu was because he was cocky and over confident same as he was against Cell. Gohan's time in the spotlight was against Cell and should be good enough for the fans since that's more than every other character has done besides Goku. And you talk about how Gohan not beating Buu makes for an unsatisfied character arc yet Vegeta after killing himself failed to beat Buu and had his kill stolen against Freeza yet that's acceptable for the fans but not for Gohan's is completely bullshit. newlinechar  newlinechar  I understand why the fans want Gohan strong and relevant, but my issue with it is that there is a massive double standard with Gohan, such as free power ups are terrible for everyone but Gohan.
It’s one of the most serious cancers. My wife teaches at a high school where a football player had knee pain.

&gt;I'd rather they be paid so I can help keep the developer in business. newlinechar  newlinechar That's very dishonest. There are a large slew of developers who support their games with free updates long after release, Rocket League, Stardew Valley, Subnautica, etc. It's fair they charge $10 or so for content packs like Mr. Torgue's, it took development time and I think it's fair to compensate as such. But charging for what is essentially raising the level cap and scaling enemies? An intern could have done that as a side project, and I don't think the raid nor the pearlescent weapons had the same value as a pack like Tiny Tina's. UVHM should have been a free update.

My fav things about it: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Packaging - this might sound silly, but it comes with a plastic lid/cover that has a built-in slot for the mini spatula so you never have to use you fingers to scoop the product out (or lose small spatulas all the time if you're like me). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 2) The balm itself - I used this when my skin was an oil-slick pre-Accutane, and it continues to work great since starting Accutane. It has a light scent, but it's not unpleasant. Kinda herbal and sweet? It melts super quick and really takes off ALL your makeup/sunscreen. It was actually helping my skin heal/improve pre-Accutane. I switched back to Albolene for a week when I was traveling and started getting clogged pores on my forehead again. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Probably the most relevant for you - with other cleansers like this, I've always had to wash my face after (like the 2 step Korean cleansing method). I don't even bother washing my face after this. I use a microfiber cloth to wipe it off and my face feels clean and very hydrated after. I've taken a cotton pad w/ witch hazel or micellar water after to check, and they swipe clean. It gets everything off w/out drying me out, breaking me out, or requiring a 2nd wash (I'm lazy and like to sleep as much as possible, ha). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Aaand that's probably a much longer response than you wanted. =P newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Also, I have really sensitive eyes and severe blepharitis (dry eyes). I haven't worn any eye makeup at all (no mascara, eye liner, eye shadows, etc. - literally nothing) in years save the very rare special occasion. Most cleansers irritate the skin near my eyes, but this one doesn't, and that's a huge plus for me.
That's the joke...

Not on a 3V power supply as OP said they have. The WS2812 need 5V, and much below that they don't work so well. I made a neck tie with a WS2812 strip driven by an ATTiny, but I had to power it with 2 coin cell batteries and use a voltage regulator to keep it at 5V. Once the batteries started to go, the blue light stopped working. Then it wouldn't update properly. Eventually it just stopped working. And that was all well above 3V.

You're right on the gem price, I was looking at the wrong column.

LS3 gives much better rewards with stat-selectable (of everything pre-PoF) Ascended trinkets, another Mastery track, and the maps. newlinechar  newlinechar And yeah, for anything less than rare you'll generally make more money from salvaging them for materials than you do directly selling them.

Your hang up is more that he's sixteen I suspect.  I think you should be careful, as even if the age of consent is 16 in your country, it usually comes with some provisions that could be bad for you legally.

Wow, that is a serious budget for a car! If you don't already have something in mind, I think spending that much is unnecessary.

I was under the assumption that all of Tammy's gathering of information *was* taking place in the new Twin Peaks timeline, no?

I like the show too but I can recognize a bad episode when I see it. And it was bad.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's been universally recognized as bad. Because it is. 
Me too. The Spin Doctors were so underrated!
I've seen this idea argued a couple of different ways. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;what is it that makes good more 'real' than evil newlinechar  newlinechar CS Lewis explains moral evil as spoiled good in [Mere Christianity](https://www.dacc.edu/assets/pdfs/PCM/merechristianitylewis.pdf): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If Dualism is true, then the bad Power must be a being who likes badness for its own sake. But in reality we have no experience of anyone liking badness just because it is bad. The nearest we can get to it is in cruelty. But in real life people are cruel for one of two reasons— either because they are sadists, that is, because they have a sexual perversion which makes cruelty a cause of sensual pleasure to them, or else for the sake of something they are going to get out of it—money, or power, or safety. But pleasure, money, power, and safety are all, as far as they go, good things. The badness consists in pursuing them by the wrong method, or in the wrong way, or too much. I do not mean, of course, that the people who do this are not desperately wicked. I do mean that wickedness, when you examine it, turns out to be the pursuit of some good in the wrong way.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You can be good for the mere sake of goodness: you cannot be bad for the mere sake of badness. You can do a kind action when you are not feeling kind and when it gives you no pleasure, simply because kindness is right; but no one ever did a cruel action simply because cruelty is wrong—only because cruelty was pleasant or useful to him. In other words badness cannot succeed even in being bad in the same way in which goodness is good. Goodness is, so to speak, itself: badness is only spoiled goodness. newlinechar  newlinechar --- newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;evil as the absence of good... God is not only good, but goodness itself newlinechar  newlinechar The idea of good as existence is from [Aristotle](http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06636b.htm): newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Starting from the Platonic definition, good is that which all desire, Aristotle, rejecting the Platonic doctrine of a transcendent world of ideas, holds that the **good and being are identical**; good is not something added to being, it is being. Everything that is, is good because it is; the quantity, if one may use the word loosely, of being or existence which a thing possesses, is at the same time the stock of goodness. A diminution or an increase of its being is a diminution or increase of its goodness. Being and the good are, then, objectively the same, every being is good, every good is being. Our concepts, being and good differ formally: the first simply denotes existence; the second, **existence as a perfection, or the power of contributing to the perfection of a being**. It follows from this that evil is not being at all; it is, on the contrary, the privation of being. Again, while being, viewed as the object of tendency, appetite, or will, gives rise to the concept good, so, when considered as the proper object of the intellect, it is represented under the concept true or truth, and it is the beautiful, inasmuch as the knowledge of it is attended by that particular pleasurable emotion which we call aesthetic. As **god is the fullness of being, so, therefore, the supreme, infinite Being is also the Supreme Good** from which all creatures derive their being and goodness. newlinechar  newlinechar My emphasis on the main points since it's not easy to follow (not sure I fully follow myself). God is the fullness of being (purely actual/existent with no potentiality). Goodness and being are identical because to *actually be* good is to *be actual*, to be evil is not to be. So as God is pure actuality he's all good, with no potentiality there's no evil or lack of good/being in him.
Sure.  But religion still has a use and is growing as a % of the population.

Not really. This is about consistency, tone-wise, character-wise and emotion-wise (if this last one makes sense). newlinechar  newlinechar JL theme from tv is wished and welcome, but not required. The Man of Steel theme, at the very least, is.

Hm that's true. I guess I just see whm healing as /u/Perryn described it, so capable of healing a lot more but leaves scars etc, and ast healing being the one that leaves no traces but is less effective the bigger the injury is or something like that.

It's most likely not on Riot's list at all. You can already choose between multiple European languages in Europe servers, Riot just chose to tie available languages to the server for some strange reasons.
