Well Areola is yet to concede a goal in CL this season. He improved a lot. He's always been good actually but last season was tough for him. If there's one thing I didn't like about Emery, it's how he handled the gk rotation last season, made both lose confidence. Didn't help that our ex keeper coach was famous for making all our keepers regress since years. He's gone now, and Areola is looking good again. Right now we don't need Oblak.

Conte's fault is selecting the player despite consistently bad performances.

Would love to know the best way to prep prawns for fried rice. I've seen several. Soaking them in sugar water, boiling them shell on in salty water before peeling, marinade in egg white, soy sauce, and white pepper... newlinechar  newlinechar The challenge is really to get the prawns to have a fresh taste and texture even after the harsh frying. That's the bit I'm working on, anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar You've really got to try to get this egg floss right. Get it into a jug so that you can control the stream. Plenty of good hot oil. Hot enough to cook the egg immediately, not hot enough to burn them. Really thin stream. A single egg should take about 10 seconds to finish pouring. Keep whisking the oil and egg with a ladle. Do it right and the egg will pretty much foam up and absorb all the oil, even if you put 5x the amount you did there. newlinechar  newlinechar Strain, there's really no need to throw the oil away. Filter and recycle it like everyone does. newlinechar  newlinechar The texture it gives to the fried rice is otherworldly.

Yeah, that's the difference. If your buddy was the defender then you'd absolutely be doing the right thing having his back. That'd be downright noble. But OP's buddy thinking the right thing to do is have his group jump a guy makes him a thug, his philosophy is no better than a mugger's. Your friends don't start fights, they're just willing to finish them. newlinechar  newlinechar When buddy is the aggressor, he's got a responsibility to make sure the fight stays ended when it's over, and to be ready if someone else jumps in. But when it's mano-a-mano he should stay out of the way, and friendo is being a big baby whining about losing instead of owning it.

Not defending his actions, but isn't the whole story 'Kevin Spacey acted inappropriately towards an under-age person, but did not molest/rape them before they denied consent and left?'  newlinechar  newlinechar If Spacey *was* aware of the boy's age it's creepy and kinda pedophiley, sure.. but he didn't *actually* rape or molest the boy. He (allegedly) made inappropriate advances, and when the boy did not consent, he was free to get up and leave. Sounds like the opposite of rape, doesn't it? newlinechar  newlinechar Still kinda fucked up (assuming Spacey knew the boy was only 14 years old) for sure, but not even remotely on the same level as Weinstein or Polanski fucked up.

I don’t necessarily disagree, I was a big voice saying osu shouldn’t have made the playoffs with the vt loss. But the committee obviously doesn’t agree. I don’t think they completely disregard the loss but I think they value big wins and number of big wins more so say Clemson beat Syracuse and lost to va tech, they would have been ranked lower. Even though va tech would have been a “better loss” they would have been sent below osu and ou since their losses were better and the rest of their resume would be more equal

Cash Flow means they can maintain the capital they need without raising more money.

Dans le sud de l’Europe (Espagne, Portugal, Grèce) il est impensable de vivre sans volets parce qu'ils permettent de bloquer le soleil, et donc conserver la fraîcheur a l'intérieur surtout en été. newlinechar C'est encore valable dans le sud de la France, et même à Paris, ou en été mes volets aident à garder l'intérieur respirable. newlinechar  newlinechar En Angleterre et plus au nord, je suppose que c'est beaucoup moins utile, et vu que le soleil est plus rare, ils ont surement envie d'en profiter au maxium plutôt que de s'en cacher. newlinechar  newlinechar De plus, mais ce n'est qu'un avis personnel, ça aide beaucoup pour le someil. Chez moi, si je n'ai pas de réveil, et les volets fermés, je peux dormir jusqu'à 10+ heures en vacances, mais ici, le soleil me réveille plus facilement le matin. C'est peu être aussi une question d'habitude ...

I would agree with that if it was building a new stadium but not for upgrading.  My Sutton utd team we spent 3 years in the championship with a 2000 seat capacity stadium.  Each year we sold 2000 season tickets, but each month we would be losing money even though I was well below wage budget to try and save money. At the end of the year solidarity payments would push the balance back into the black.  At the end of the 1st season in the prem, we had 60mil in the bank, we'd finished 15th and well clear of relegation on points.  So the board spends 3 mil to upgrade by 1800 seats?  How is that realistic?  Even if they spent 20 odd mil to fully upgrade to the stadiums maximum expansion of 15k (I think),  we still guaranteed another season in the prem = 90 mil tv money.  So even if we go down after that, don't tell me I will struggle to fill that 15k capacity stadium in the championship so at least my match day income will be 7.5 times better than last time I was in the championship.

TIL!

Whenever I did castellan toad runs though, I'd do all 20 channels in one sitting, which was about 1 hour 10/20min to go through all those channels. Ardentmill would have saved me 3 jq per 20 channel run cycle, which cuts down the total time from the 1hr 10/20 min roughly by 9-12 minutes

Yes, they are written in opposite direction. Or at least that's the way I write them. In the history there were examples of some scripts that can change direction. Notably Egyptian hieroglyphics could be written left-to-right, right-to-left or top-to-bottom. Though I hadn't decided yet if I want this loose sense of direction of text or a stricter one; so for now I am writing block meduan left-to-right and cursive meduan right-to-left.

The first example assumes you have 4 elixir, and then you regenerate at least 8 elixir by the time freeze runs out. That's not what happens. Freeze does not buy you time--it only delays the inevitable, and you could only ever use it if you've already played something that does a ton of damage--otherwise you really need to play another card. And while you freeze my whole push, I'm just going to add another threat. Maybe I'll even push the other lane. Now what are you going to do? newlinechar  newlinechar Cloning a bunch of small units leaves everything susceptible to spells. But so does freezing everything while your small units go to work. Again, the whole point of clone is to surprise your opponent--when do they have no spells? Or better yet, clone is another spell-bait card in your deck when you want to include a few mini tanks. You're not risking anything by cloning if you know what your opponent has. Tornado and Executioner are not pocket cards, so you'll know when they have them in rotation. newlinechar  newlinechar Now let's think about it from the perspective of your opponent knowing what you have--freeze is countered by spreading out your troops. Clone is countered by holding onto the spells/counters you need. But a good clone deck is going to try to bait out your spells somewhere else. And a good freeze deck is going to have a mechanism for punishing spread out troops. But which one is easier to deal with? It all depends on your deck matchup. newlinechar  newlinechar Freeze is awesome when your opponent has no elixir to deal with your attack. Clone is awesome for the same reasons. Anything placed down right away can counter freeze pretty well, but you need certain counters to deal with clone. So there are advantages and disadvantages to each. newlinechar  newlinechar

Yes, that's probably true. But I would imagine most people coming here would admit that people like Limbaugh and Hannity are beyond the pale... It's hard to talk about this issue because I do think it's a genuine problem that adds to the extreme partisanship and disfunction of our country... and is (at least slightly) more extreme on the right... but I take your point, that it's not necessarily productive to belabor the topic if we want to remain a welcoming space for diverse viewpoints.

It ended in a great depression (well, not just the monetary shock, but trying to balance the budget in the middle of a recession). Internal devaluations are godawful. You had to live with the level of unemployment generated to understand it. newlinechar  newlinechar I think the current path where the current center right government changed to a floating currency and increased interest rates is easier to handle (that being said, the fiscal side is not being handled as good as possible, and it's risky because it replaces monetary emission with debt). newlinechar  newlinechar There is a limit to the shocks a country can handle (I used the term overshoot for a reason, this is kind of a control engineering thing, :P), and if the endgame is left wing populists when people end distrusting the political establishment, it's just self defeating.

In isolation the symbolism per person doesn’t look like much but in context it’s worth taking note of. That’s all I’m doing as far as Richard at the moment. I haven’t concluded anything even about Howard. I just lean further towards the direction of believing he’s a luciferian illuminati member rather than a wildly successful natural talent. So far as a case study Howard Stern does look like a member of the luciferian illuminati to me. So far my Howard Stern show research supports the theory that top celebs are members. The more I look into it the more supporting evidence I find. They use double meanings and hide things so it’s not going to ever be straightforward. It’s a secret society. It’s pretty much all in our faces but until they admit they are in a secret society it’s hard to accept as a reality because there’s witchcraft involved and we are all under a strong delusion. These people are perfectly possessed. They aren’t normal people. We aren’t free from other brainwashing influences from the media either. newlinechar  newlinechar There’s a lot of psychopathic behavior involved where we cant easily see when they are lying because there isn’t that nervousness or guilt that we look for to tell when someone’s lying. Anyway, I’m just collecting evidence. Thx for the feedback. No one else has to be involved in the illuminati for Howard to be involved. It’s just a possibility that’s he’s not the only one if he is. I’m sure his bosses/agent are involved if he is. Usually the further down the foodchain the more mind control slaves there are or people who are working with them but unaware of the fact that they are luciferians that they work for. Most freemasons don’t even know they are in a devil worshipping cult. They don’t inquire usually but the info is there which includes witchcraft/Kabbalah/new age religion practices (which arent new at all.)   newlinechar  newlinechar A Vatican priest named [father Malachi Martin ](https://youtu.be/bPH_OgdXFoQ ) said that they coordinate easily without words because their demons recognize eachother even if two illuminati members have never met. A lot of why this is hard to accept as a possibility is that it requires a lot of research to decode/recognize the telltale patterns. In the 90s Vatican exorcist father Malachi Martin estimated that there are ten million perfectly possessed closet luciferians functioning in regular jobs and families and many in high ranking positions.

Cheers mate, appreciate it. I've tried many times to stop in all the time I've been smoking, this time I've had no anxiety, side effects or withdrawals. I know when I was offered the share, it was because the opportunity arose, and not doing it reinforced my desire and resolve to quit, so that occurrence won't happen again amongst my smoking mates, as they respect my decision that I've quit. Every time I had an urge two months ago, not having my dealers number took away any anxiety, it was quite easy saying to myself, you know you can't get any, and it was as simple as that.

This late in the season I doubt i'll find that coveted league winner but I don't wanna miss out on Juju trying to chase that player

No she isn’t seeking professional help. We have discussed this many times in the past. She had tried it before (only going for one or two sessions then ultimately stop goin because it “isn’t working”). Her usual response if it is ever brought up, is that she doesn’t have the time due until the week. newlinechar  newlinechar Starting to think that I need to just delve myself into a new hobby. This way I can focus on it and get motivated myself for doing it. Maybe my new attitude towards it and being excited for run off on her. I have tried something like this before, but never full force into something new that I get excited for myself. Seems like it could work? newlinechar

Actually the F-35 has better range than the F-22, double check your stats, most websites list the f-22 range with drop tanks but list the F-35 range on internal fuel only.

Most countries the law permits kids to have sex as long as they're withing age range of each other. The reason we have statutory laws, is because of the power difference in the relationship. I'm 35 yo, and i've dated a few 20-22yos, and the power dynamic was so heavily tipped in my balance i could have seriously mistreated these girls if i possessed the desire to do it. I could coerce them into pretty much whatever I wanted. Increase that age difference to 30-40 years, and the less powerful partner would pretty much have their will overridden and will (not legally) consent to whatever is asked of them.

So to avoid it they tip toe around saying falsehoods or untruths or false statements, simply because of the stigma around calling one side a liar.

There's bound to be some shakeup and it will make it easier. newlinechar  newlinechar If this did happen, it will certainly be an important factor, but that's assuming that all teams look to be on the same level based on resume and eye test. OU gets the edge over Ohio State due to the H2H, then it's all based on the tiniest separating factors, one of them being Clemson's loss to Syracuse. newlinechar  newlinechar It should also be noted though that we have no idea how much value they're putting in the loss to Syracuse.

yes they do, and that is part of the cycle. you know, the one that casts a nasty big shadow over the homosexual community. that same shadow the original comment pointed out, the one i said wasn't wrong and you just helped to drive the point home.

**edit:** probably important to clarify that I'm from Canada and am starting in BC, which is why it's a bit more of a hassle compared to being American (USA just applies for a Canadian entry permit). newlinechar  newlinechar Anyways, maybe it's beneficial to outline what my current understanding is: newlinechar  newlinechar * Going right from Manning Park in BC, touching the northern terminus, and heading south into the US on the PCT is now considered illegal. newlinechar  newlinechar * I have to officially check in with border security. Okay cool - where? Nearest officially supported crossing? Nearest border town? newlinechar  newlinechar * Once that is complete...do I head back to Manning Park/northern terminus and now have permission to head south and cross CAD/US border? Or am I only able to reach the border and turn around and head south (ie., stay in the US once checked in)? newlinechar  newlinechar Probably overthinking it, but it's just part of my planning and not wanting to mess up!

Thanks for the reply! newlinechar  newlinechar * The 10x squads are a concern. For the 1000pts list I needed a third troop choice to get the battalion detachment. When I move up to 1500 I do expand these units to higher numbers. I've heard mixed reviews on Reanimation Protocol and it's affect on our unit size choice, but I'm in the same camp as you. newlinechar  newlinechar * I like the CCB idea! I think a CCB would be ideal, I'm just expanding off of the Start Collecting box, which gives the overlord. From what I've heard the CCB is one of Necron's best units. newlinechar  newlinechar * I think speed is the big issue with Necron's in general. Scarabs could certainly help, but I couldn't find room for them. This would be an issue I'd have to address after having more experience. newlinechar  newlinechar * I'm not familiar with the term wrinkle. Sorry I've just started the hobby. newlinechar  newlinechar * The list does have issues with melee. One tactic that I've seen is to use the Ghost Ark to block of charges for your warriors. It seems that our anti-melee is pretty overcosted imo. This makes it difficult to include in lower points games. newlinechar  newlinechar * I think that Tesla Immortals vs Warriors is a toss up. Tesla certainly outputs more shots, but then you lose the unit size/Ghost Ark synergy. newlinechar  newlinechar * As mentioned above, I think Scarabs would be a great addition if I could find the points. You hit the nail on the head with their uses. newlinechar  newlinechar The two Stalkers are there for anti-tank/monstrous creatures. After reading your comment I think I will look into finding a way to fit some Scarabs into the list. They seem to be very versatile and address a lot of the concerns.

Obama still could've spiked it even if it was unanimous in favor.  newlinechar  newlinechar Exclusively targeting Clinton requires either (a) taking a chance that she's the only no vote, risking wasted time/money/exposure if the deal gets killed anyway, (b) knowing Clinton was the only no vote through extensive intelligence operation targeting multiple independent federal agencies or (c) recruiting her to actively advocate on their behalf and convince the representatives of eight departments to vote in favor.

Cops will cause less collateral damage and need fewer shots to neutralize threats with patrol rifles, and they will survive getting shot better with hard body armor.

Yes. newlinechar  newlinechar You can either do a BSc in CPSC or a BA in CPSC. newlinechar The two programs are pretty much the same, but separated in that regard and so are the seats that they give out to students... so, you can either go science or arts first year and then apply for CPSC as long as you have a competitive average (80%+). newlinechar  newlinechar I'd recommend science or arts depending on what courses you're good at. If you're good at science (bio/phys/chem/math) definitely go for science, it'll likely be easier to get higher grades than arts. newlinechar  newlinechar

A 5/6 swinging at you after settle the wreckage or any other nasty spell will kill you. Many Control decks need the gearhulk to get lethal damage off, and it's so flexible.

I'm not a fan of the 5 month timeline, the bait and switch of twitch drops, the massive lack of communication when it comes to anything related to the future of the game, the complete absence of any effort to create a tournament scene. I love the game and I am sure the cards are going to be fun and interesting but the amount of communication and community involvement is worse than any other card game on the market. And in response to u/Renegade020 's comment the card balance is fine. I have never heard anyone who has finished in the top 100 have any serious enduring complaints about card balance. The only real complaints about card balance are from the people who refuse to adapt their deck to ramp scout or aggro sader. Just because you don't want to adapt to a deck doesn't mean that that deck is broken. Ramp scout is fine, monored sader is fine, stop whining over the wrong things.  newlinechar  newlinechar In short the problem I have with the game right now isn't the expansion but the time line and lack of communication and development occurring around it.  newlinechar  newlinechar And yes it is me, hi Xen :D

Super valid point; hadn’t considered that.  I just wouldn’t want them to literally cut corners. 
I guess, same as everywhere else, some people are more to compete, others go more chill. And yes here things are pretty expensive too, so its hard to make big cosplays, plus you need to put lots of time , time which I could be doing other things. 
So it's not literally on the box then. Unless someone goes out of their way to Google it and thus potentially spoil the game for themselves, they're not going to know, and we know not many people are going to do that.  newlinechar  newlinechar That's not necessarily a problem, and I don't think games need to warn about every single thing that's in them that could upset someone. But it *is* why it's super important that this sort of situation gets portrayed the right way. And I do not trust David Cage to do that.
That's not new, that's a very very old talking point, wrapped in a new format. It doesn't have any merit in the argument against slavery, the race of the slave owner is moot. But if you're trying to whitewash history, it's used as a smokescreen.

What are you talking about?  There are quite a few options that are accepted widely - globally in fact.   newlinechar  newlinechar Got in at $10 based on understanding the technology fundamentals at &lt; $1. Im doing just fine. But you're right, I dont really care.
I'm basically saving Quest Mods for a future update. 4.0 is a lot more about solidifying US's basis from a gameplay standpoint, and once that basis is more secure, we can think about adding in more content to explore.

Today I built EOW&gt;Athenes&gt;Ardent&gt;Redmption and that took me about 32 minutes. I felt so useless. My heals weren't doing shit. Is that because Athenes is a useless gold sink or something?

I agree with you that Wii 2 doesn't do the system justice.  It would have been better if they'd gone with a different name entirely, as they have with the Switch, but they were very obviously *trying* to capitalize on the Wii's success and name recognition and Wii 2 does that better than Wii U.
&gt; They can use condoms? And if condoms didn't work, abortion? Which is what happens with the vast majority of non-siblings who abort a fetus, after a screening showed a high risk of down syndrome or some severe deformity. newlinechar  newlinechar You do know abortion can have the side effect of infertility?  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Also to your point down below about Islamic immigrants, inbreeding is more common among Muslims because Muhammad had cousin marriages, and maybe also because they're less likely to abort a fetus because of their religion. It doesn't mean the same would happen among non-Muslim Dutch/Brits/French etc, in fact it doesn't. newlinechar  newlinechar There is nothing genetic about Dutch, Brits or French stopping them from inbreeding. Sixty years ago you had the mechanism of the Church stopping those things from happening. If you legalize it and - as some people advocate here - make it less taboo, what do you think the effect will be 50 years in the future?

I think there's a sorta rural simplicity to a lot of NZ's features. Some of the gags (the police officers for example) may not work as well in a US setting I feel. I think the most kiwi comedy I can think of is either Hunt for the Wilderpeople or Police Ten Seven (not a comedy show but it manages to be funny all the same!).  I feel maybe you still get that in the US, so an American remake could work. newlinechar  newlinechar I feel it could do wonders in a Flight of the Conchords style show where the vampires are trying to adapt to modern life.
Yep! You're correct!
Very excited. Thank you for the great videos!
I think I like Cake because my natural lip colour is a light cool toned pink and it lightly neutralises, warms, and evens them without looking like I've really got anything on.  The Like shade is basically the colour of my lips so it evens them out and brightens 'em a little.  I know these two are the most subtle of the Generation G range and I really enjoy them for that, and I'm definitely curious about the brighter shades. newlinechar  newlinechar I loved the sample of the perfume too and wore it for a week before caving in and ordering a bottle, which should be arriving tomorrow or yay.  It's such a soft and lovely scent that works well with my skin chemistry and I've been wanting something like it for a long time. newlinechar  newlinechar I haven't ventured into the body stuff yet but the shower oil sounds wonderful!

We can disagree on exactly how bad it was, but you have to say it was pretty bad, and would be considered unusable by today's standards if it didn't have the C++-sourced improvements. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Most of that code is actually ok. newlinechar  newlinechar Of course; I wrote it! 😉 newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Function arity can be checked if you do this: newlinechar  newlinechar I may be mistaken, since it was before my time, but I think that's only if the declaration is visible? Which it wouldn't have been for early libc's with no headers. In any case, that is an error in my example code, thanks. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; `//` comments newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, they aren't a need-to-have, but they're certainly a nice-to-have. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; `inline` newlinechar  newlinechar Not so important nowadays, but it played a big part in making macro soup go out of style. And function definitions in headers/header-only libraries are still both nice-to-haves. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; `const` newlinechar  newlinechar Its main utility is clearly documenting (and statically checking your assumptions regarding) when pointer parameters mutate the referent, which is a pretty huge plus.

https://www.winebusiness.com/tools/?go=winemaking.calc&amp;cid=15 newlinechar  newlinechar For future reference, the Wine Business calculator will do a lot of this for you. newlinechar  newlinechar It’s high, but not crazy. For reference, you can do 25ppm SO2 if the grapes are pristine, 50ppm for average fruit, and 75ppm for poor fruit. So ~100 is high but you didn’t ruin anything. SO2 will offgas anyway over time. If you pour the juice back and forth in buckets a few times it will help. newlinechar  newlinechar You might want to add some yeast in another day or two to make sure the strain you want becomes the dominant strain, especially if it has been sitting out in the open (where native yeast could begin fermenting). newlinechar  newlinechar pH does have an impact on SO2 (look up molecular SO2), but odds are that you are fine for home winemaking.

The seat bag hasn't swayed noticeably in the month or so I've been commuting with it.

It has nothing to do with “small is beautiful” or any of that nonsense, it’s directly to do with inefficiency of infrastructure development directed by larger governments. newlinechar  newlinechar There’s a reason the feds write cheques but don’t organize the bridges, water, and sewers of our cities. Every layer added is another political battlefield to die on, and that’s been the issue for nuclear for 60 years. Reactors have cost too much for most municipality’s without signing away the keys to the feds, and the feds don’t want (and shouldn’t) manage the energy supplies. newlinechar  newlinechar It’s not about “buying local”, it’s about Engineering reactors that are inexpensive enough for populations under a million people to afford. newlinechar

The thing about it is that it's a six mana sorcery that doesn't affect the board and also needs some other specific cards to win, and if the opponent isn't getting milled to zero cards it effectively does nothing. Maybe it could be a deck in modern with [[Fraying Sanity]] and [[Traumatize]] for redundancy but even that feels kind of clunky. As for commander, it would probably just be banned. (Or maybe not; it's kind of impossible to predict what will be banned in commander. I still don't understand why [[Sylvan Primordial]] is banned but [[Sol Ring]] and [[Mana Crypt]] are both ok.)

Normally the colonists automatically harvest any farm plants that are fully grown, just make sure you set a priority of 1 for the Growing of at least one colonist on your work tab so they won't spend their time doing other tasks. You can also go to the Architect tab, select the Harvest order and drag a box over the plants you want to harvest so you don't need to click on each plant (that will also tell your colonist to harvest half grown plants). newlinechar  newlinechar If you feel like venturing further, there are mods that let you set different priorities to sowing/harvesting plants, because by default these two tasks falls under the Growing skill but sometimes you want to prioritize one task over the other.

I'm not really sure, Chryst just has that sort of attitude where he doesn't like to run up the score. If we get the ball left with 7 minutes left in the 4th Chryst just tries to have a long drive and end the game without scoring.  We ended the game on the Purdue 5 on like an 8 minute drive.

$200 is a great price!  newlinechar  newlinechar It also depends when you fly.

I'm not asking for that. I don't really mind religious politicians or people in general so long as they aren't using bigotry to 1) make fucked up policies that have no reason, and 2) manipulating those that are generally decent but a little ignorant into hate filled people. This has been *far* from the case, as history has shown, with religious government.  newlinechar  newlinechar And, absolutely I agree there are dangerous atheists out there. A lot of atheists on here are extremely bigoted, not going to even try denying that. I'm just talking about who's really holding power as of this moment. In the US, it's the religious right. You see people trying to justify their homophobia or trying to deny LGBTQ+ people rights by claiming they are Christian.  newlinechar  newlinechar Not all Christians are like that, and similarly not all men are rapists, not all white people are racists, we all know this. It's who's holding power in a system that is *extremely* biased. I'm finding it hard to disagree with your overall point, though. People who have these views to begin with and are charismatic enough will have influence and it's ultimately going to be detrimental to a *ton* of minority groups.

Standard government numbers are 9million per life, FYI.  I know we're talking about rape, but we can start with murder as a baseline and then consider how disruptive rape is to a person's remaining life.  Total disruption being it causes suicide and its equivalent to murder, no disruption meaning the person forgets it ever happened. newlinechar  newlinechar So your average tax evasion case needs to be at minimum $9 million in avoided taxes to be economically equivalent to a murder.  it would be significantly more if you want it to be economically and morally equivalent. newlinechar  newlinechar The median case for tax fraud is a bit under 170,000. (source: https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/research-and-publications/quick-facts/Quick_Facts_Tax-Fraud_FY14.pdf) newlinechar  newlinechar So without a doubt your average murder is way worse economically than tax evasion.  I'd be willing to bet rape has a stronger affect than 1/50th of a murder so that would make tax evasion the least important of the three, economically. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't think I even need to argue the order of them morally.

For the record, I do not care where you post, I was just going for the rhetorical value there. That was the strongest argument I could make.  newlinechar  newlinechar And you did kinda blame the Greens in Michigan and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin and every other swing state for electing Trump... newlinechar  newlinechar The reality is, they simply did not play a role in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Stein was bringing new voters in, not converting existing ones, this is proven by a CNN exit poll that showed that 67% of 3rd party voters wouldn't have voted in a two-party race. And in Michigan? Voter suppression in Detroit and Clinton's poor strategy played a way bigger role in the loss than Jill Stein possibly could have. newlinechar  newlinechar EDIT: Looking at that post history shows that they are a supporter of Krugman's capitalist economics, even though the Greens are eco-socialist.

I don’t understand why she’d continue a friendship with him though, knowing he doesn’t want a friendship. I’m in a relationship and out of respect for my partner I’d put an end to a friendship once the friend made it clear they wanted more and wouldn’t take no for an answer. Out of respect for myself too. If somebody won’t respect my intentions and feelings then they aren’t a very good friend anyway.

I've been sort of thinking about this for a while. I know that Mercer ran some wildly successful Hedge Fund and is considered something of a technical/financial genius. But what if he's not actually a Genius, and just invested in corrupt Oligarch's businesses basically insider trading with people in other countries. His money might be tied up in the Magnitsky act like the rest of them and he'd be subject to a whole ton of penalties from Foreign Corrupt Business act. But I don't know nearly enough about the financial industry to make that claim with any basis, just an interesting thought form my perspective. 
At least based on empirical results[1], people accepted my explicit statements that (a) it was sent to enough (10+) people that I couldn't correlate comments back to them, and (b) even if I happened to do so (like because they mentioned a specific thing), I would never mention it in person. As my form intro said, the feedback was a one-way black hole. newlinechar  newlinechar My guess is that people accept this because the only people who would go to the effort of requesting comments about themselves, are also those who can be trusted to keep it anonymous, and/or who would truly appreciate it if it wasn't anonymous. This hack is not appealing to people who don't value criticism :-) newlinechar  newlinechar [1]: While a sample size of 1 isn't great, it says a lot more than a sample size of 0 ;-)

The way it's going, it's going to be a hard 2018 for any Republican. And you're right, the Republican agenda has been a complete failure under his tenure.

Because GearVR apps run on Android (uses Android system calls and libraries) and on an ARM CPU. It also does not have positional tracking and so apps are not tested or built for it. The input method is also different. Button mapping could be made but again, 6dof controllers would break the game.  newlinechar  newlinechar It would be possible to run Android inside an ARM emulator and limit the Rift and Touch to 3dof but it would be neither fun nor trivial. newlinechar  newlinechar It's much easier for a dev who wants to release on both to just use something like Unity or Unreal Engine and compile and test its app on both platforms.

I would also recommend calling the Landlord-Tenant office, few things I would recommend from my experiences (IANAL, I've just had lots of bad landlords) newlinechar    newlinechar * Pay your rent in full, the landlord can serve you an eviction notice and generally make things annoying for you as a tenant.   newlinechar * You are entitled to your security deposit full stop. It does not matter what sort of lease you have signed, the only exception to this is if you are leaving and cleaning can be deducted. A landlord may not withhold rent owing from a security deposit unless you make the arrangement with them.   newlinechar * Document everything, even conversations. Canada is a single party consent state for recording, you can legally record any conversation you are a part of. Failing this, transcribe the conversation, sign it and distribute to the parties involved.   newlinechar * Was your other roommate party to the verbal agreement with the third? If so, consider writing up your verbal agreement, signing it and having your roommate sign it as witness. Please talk to the tenant board about this situation, the landlord would generally be the one holding a tenants belongings ransom for unpaid rent so far as I know, and only after the eviction notice is served, not challenged and the 14 days is up, otherwise the person can call an officer to get their stuff.   newlinechar * If you feel they will flake, the only way you are going to get repaid is small claims. I do not recommend holding their stuff ransom as you may not have the law on your side. Contact one of the many free legal advice groups in Alberta or see if your work offers it through benefits. It may not even be worth pursuing due to the cost to file and the time required but still, contact a legal advice group. newlinechar  newlinechar    newlinechar Also, does the lease end on the 1st or the 31st? You have until 23:59 the day the lease agreement terminates on to pay rent so far as I know

Sell things of higher value, or sell to places that will pay more. newlinechar  newlinechar My friend makes $600 a weekend selling frozen empanadas at festivals. newlinechar  newlinechar Management has to understand what assets they have, and how to capitalize on it.  The answer might not be obvious. newlinechar  newlinechar The Washington Post makes money selling arc publishing tools. newlinechar  newlinechar The product a pizza place might sell might not be pizzas.  newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe it's high end speak easy style dinners?  It could be a 6 hour shift that pays $300. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe it's catered lunches tailored to an office twice a week.  That could be a 4 hour shift that pays $150. newlinechar  newlinechar Maybe it's selling space overnight to a small commercial bakery.  Maybe that pizza place sells specialty desserts to local restaurants. newlinechar  newlinechar It is possible.  Management has to be willing though.  If management breaks even with more work, but more of their employees get paid then that has to be worth it.  They have to say that paying high wages is a value to the company - Just like Ford motor company did. newlinechar  newlinechar

If the moving up/booking the next gig is true, then getting fired shouldn't be a big deal. (Or she could have chosen to walk away.)

That's a decent salary in some of the lower cost of income states. But it's hardly the big bucks, especially if you take time off unpaid for relaxation, vacation, etc., and have to pay for your own health insurance, fund your own retirement, etc.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's a decent paying job for 45-50 hours a week, especially not on the coasts, but not at the hectic pace they go.  newlinechar  newlinechar Are there other jobs in that field that pay more? Guess is people take the job because they need to. Nothing about Hollywood appeals to me, so I can't really relate. But especially not a reality TV job. Id much rather get a steady boring job with benefits, paid time off, and some life balance. But that's just me. A job is a job, so I want the one that pays the most for the least amount of life suck. Which is NOT what Hollywood is about. So I respect my opinion is different.

It really only becomes important when you’re trying to cut, atleast in my case for dieting.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can do a clean bulk where you watch what you eat carefully to gain minimal fat or a dirty bulk and just eat anything in sight, but you’ll have to cut later to burn off fat gained from the bad diet. newlinechar  newlinechar I tend to eat a little bit over maintenance “by feel” for my muscles but not over eat, so I tend to stay around the same body fat while my muscles grow but it’s less efficient I would think.

Try the Secret Shrine, it's got plenty of Entombed spawns for easy exp.

If you have her, get Tatiana up to at least level 8 so she can replace Silque. I also notice you've got a lot of Lance users, I wouldn't recommend this since Lances have the weakest selection of weapons for Thabes. Rhomphaia is the best but there's only one, and it often falls short of damage on later floors. I prefer Mages and Bow Knights, so try training up Leon and Delthea. newlinechar  newlinechar You're not underleveled, that's around the same levels I usually have for starting Thabes (Your Alm and Celica are way higher than mine, who don't hit 20 until around the last floor). You need better weapons, plain and simple. Alm prefers a forged Royal Sword or Killer Bow to the Falchion, Celica should use a Mage Ring or Ladyblade

My squad always goes apartments because at the end of the day its a safe looting spot in the middle of the map which will in most cases have safe circles spawned on it. A lot of the time what you can do after looting apartments is just head to school after and pick off the half dead team thats left and usually you'll win just due to number and health advantages. Otherwise you can just camp it and kill people coming into the apartment complex because you'll have a birds eye view of the valley from the southeast apartment that stands at least another several meters taller than the highest point at school.

If that is what you understood then you need to learn how to read.
First things first, if you haven't played the Prologue mission for Karazhan yet, go do that. It's available for free (with no need to purchase the adventure), and you get two very decent cards from it: [[Firelands Portal]] and [[Enchanted Raven]]. newlinechar  newlinechar ---- newlinechar  newlinechar To be honest, Karazhan is very much a utility expansion, in that it has a *lot* of lemons (i.e. bad cards) in it. That being said, if you intend to play Discolock, Secret Hunter, Control Paladin or Midrange Shaman, the first wing is fairly important, with cards like [[Silverware Golem]], [[Cloaked Huntress]], [[Ivory Knight]] and [[Maelstrom Portal]].  newlinechar  newlinechar The advantage of buying the first wing is that you get a guaranteed legendary, or in this case, a guaranteed 400 dust (Moroes is one of those aforementioned lemons), which is a much better gold to dust conversion than buying packs on average. If you're looking to craft toward a deck, then you should probably buy the first wing of Karazhan. newlinechar  newlinechar In comparison, Un'Goro is a way better expansion in terms of general power level, since there was very little filler in it, in my opinion. However, as with all packs, you're never guaranteed to get exactly what you need/want out of the packs you buy. Thus: newlinechar  newlinechar * Do you remember how many Un'Goro packs you've opened so far? If you've opened less than ten, you're guaranteed to get a legendary within the first ten packs now, so I'd probably lean towards opening Un'Goro packs.  newlinechar * Do you know what you're looking for out of Un'Goro packs? If it's commons and rares, then opening packs is fine. If it's a couple of Epics/Legendaries, though, I would recommend crafting what you need instead of opening packs. newlinechar  newlinechar Hope this helps! :)
Honestly, that’s probably true, though Wolf times are largely outdone by the other nonstandards.  newlinechar  newlinechar That being said, Blade and Raven tomes are still prolific, whereas I almost never run across Owl tomes anywhere, and it makes me sad.

Right, but there's a full context here that I feel people are leaving out of the equation. Not being allowed to bring in new players has choked this team. We have little depth and no way to remedy that lack of death. When you combine that with the longstanding reliance on a few players in the squad and a few bad transfers, you get exhaustion. These players are exhausted. That's why they're playing so poorly, or at least that's my best explanation - players don't just turn into garbage overnight. newlinechar  newlinechar I hope you understand that a lot of my frustration is rooted in watching this sub grow and change over the years, only to see names I've never seen before come out and criticize all the players that have brought us success. It just feels wrong to me. I never expected to watch this team reach these heights, and for people to feel entitled to that is really weird to me.

It's a pretty distinct difference between a college offering benefits to employees and government using taxation to provide government subsidized education.
Sense is really good now. It's very close to Stock. You won't even really have to worry about replacing Sense apps with Google Apps because in more recent versions of Sense, HTC already did that themselves. I want to say it was when the HTC 10 came out they made a big thing about getting rid of redundant apps. Sense is very fast and snappy, some would say more so than present day TouchWiz. But it doesn't have a lot of big wow factor features like TouchWiz though. It's just an all around good, light, fast Stock-like skin that does what you need it to do.

Yes, but in the case of improv, it’s a short way of saying improvise.

I'm not going to trust any of them. They are both interest groups. newlinechar  newlinechar The SPLC has been getting a lot of criticism from very respected voices and publications these past few years. They've literally endangered the lives of good people with their hate lists(Maajid Nawaz, Ayaan Hirsi Ali, Charles Murray, to name but three). The SPLC has become a radicalized smear campaign machine for hire by social justice causes and should be viewed in a very skeptical lens.  newlinechar  newlinechar They are no more reliable than the Daily Caller. Whether or not you agree with the general of either group. newlinechar  newlinechar I think we can *all* agree that every media company is essentially an interest group and will, *at the very least*, bend the truth a little here or there, and fairly frequently to boot. Whether it is a top down approach or simply coming from journalists injecting opinion, whether Left or right, new or old, mainstream or sidestream, or whatever else, they're pretty much all guilty of it. Including the news media sites which provide you with news and opinions you generally favour.   newlinechar  newlinechar So from that baseline we can say that no one is reliable and we should maintain a healthy skepticism of all media sites, especially those we agree with.  newlinechar  newlinechar This particular story has been making the media rounds of all political flavours. The fact that this happened is not up for debate, what is up for debate however is what can be gleaned from it.  newlinechar  newlinechar I try my best to never trust a single voice, always go at least one layer up to check the sources cited, and always make sure to take a regular peak at what the proponents of opposing views are talking about.  newlinechar  newlinechar I'm not always disciplined about it and sometimes get lazy. I guess the point is that its good to be skeptical but in this case, The Daily Caller didn't lie, but lacking the time to look for the perfectly impartial journalist article about it, why not use The Daily Caller to announce it on reddit?  newlinechar  newlinechar

Yes, it is true. Friends on orange, Anaheim and Santa Ana pd all talk about the homeless that lived in the river long before they lined the edges.

They are far safer next to the river, in the view of the public, then they were down in the tunnels and this has attracted travelers (traveling homeless - who tend to be younger and not as deep into the addiction as older homeless, generally)  newlinechar  newlinechar Now this hasn’t exactly increased the homeless population over all ( as so cal has always been a common stop for those who are homeless travelers) but it has made the rivers edge a place where they are more concentrated.  Making it seems that way  newlinechar  newlinechar As for whether they are “poor souls” I can’t comment. What I do know ( this coming from one friend in OC who is a social worker, and another from LA who is also) is that most of the non-traveler homeless in the area have mild to severe mental illnesses. Without knowing their history it’s hard to tell if they became this way naturally or if it was drug induced. Either way many of them use drugs as a way to self medicate. The relief is temporary and usually makes their problem worse but for those without the means it’s Hard to see another way.  newlinechar  newlinechar As for them refusing help. Well you got people with mental problems making up a chunk of the tent city population and the other half are traveling youngsters who view their lives as a form of social rebellion so yea, getting those people to trust anybody is gonna be tough. The other 5-10% of people who are down on their luck (temporary homeless) have some sort of support or are working towards something already and will seek out that help on their own.  newlinechar  newlinechar Last thing: don’t assume that you know everything these people are going through. It’s too complicated to simplify and I certainly don’t understand most of it myself.  newlinechar  newlinechar The oracle told Socrates that he was the wisest man in the world because he was the only to admit how little he actually knew about it.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar

And then when you try practicing with a hero in competitive they tell you go to quick play for practice, but quick play is a joke because no one wants to try for real.

Everyone on ESPN has shown displeasure about the move, TT is the only one that seems to at least *try* and cover the reasons why AP is even considering it.

 newlinechar &gt;you are willing to hurt people just because they are in your way and breaking the law newlinechar  newlinechar My post didn't imply that, but for the sake of argument, I will just humor you.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;There are degrees of illegal.

Wouldn't having laws that say if you intentionally are trying to hold your own body hostage to block others the law won't protect you discourage people from breaking the law? Obviously, if there are dead corpses strewn about the street, then that person will still be held liable, but unless you drive in a way that intentionally wants to hurt/kill people, that won't happen. newlinechar

Pretty sure you're less likely to roll 2 6s on 2d6, than you are to roll a 12 on 1d12. Odds for 12 on 2d6 is 2.7%, odds for 12 on 1d12 is 8% ( http://anydice.com/ ). Because of how outcomes work. Because there are 36 possible outcomes, the chance of rolling 2 6s across 2d6s is (1/6) x (1/6) x 100 = 2.77777777778. You are more likely to roll a single 12 on 1d12, because there are only 12 outcomes, and each outcome is just as likely as the others (all of them have a 1/12 chance of occurring).

Even if it does lack a top 10 type win, they've had more solid and really good wins than any other 1 loss team, and their loss is somewhat excusable with Bryant being hurt, although I don't like that argument. Personally I'd have 4. Oklahoma 5. Ohio State 6. Clemson, but the reality is you can make convincing arguments for any order and it's not ridiculous or stupid that Clemson is at 4. People just want to be outraged.

Muitos Municípios estabelecem um valor da tarifa pros taxistas por meio de Decreto, não cabendo aos taxistas reduzirem por conta própria esses valores.

It's because the block rewards decrease statistically faster with a per block re-targeting as composed to a rolling average of 2016. With 2016 difficulty reset you are guaranteed X for those 2016 blocks. I.e., with dash, if you buy 20 miners and turn those on, the difficulty immediately accounts for those 20 miners. With bitcoin/litecoin, if you turn on 20 miners on block 16, you still have another 2000 blocks to receive continued reward at current difficulty level. This makes it cost effective and provides an incentive to upgrade mining hardware. This is a net positive to bitcoin like difficulty re-targeting algorithms and a net negative as compared to something like dash.
I'm not sure if you're kidding or not. On one hand that sound crazy and on the other it sounds possible...

&gt; Why not? The incentive would of course be if it is deemed it to be more efficient. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm talking about the incentive for those democratically locally controlling the surplus. Not the incentive for the whole of society.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What exactly would constitute a 'comparative advantage' of the same good in a market-less economy? In a market economy is would of course be a firm that would be capable of producing the same good for a lower price, but of course price wouldn't be a thing in a market-less economy. Even if a certain good were being sub-optimally produced in such an economy, which certainly should still be improved ASAP, there still wouldn't need to be any reason to affect the accessibility of the finished product.  newlinechar  newlinechar Monetary costs are an approximation of real costs. Comparative advantage doesn't necessarily refer to having lower monetary costs compared to other places this just happens to usually comes along with what it is actually referring to, real cost. When I'm talking about comparative advantage, I'm talking about having a lower real resource cost for producing the good in question compared to other places. Once we take on this understanding, it is fairly clear that comparative advantage as a concept would still exist in moneyless economy. Wasting resources is bad; therefore, comparative advantage should be taken advantage of wherever possible.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; If you can speculate this possibility, why couldn't this be considered and planned accordingly? newlinechar  newlinechar The reason is deeply technical has to do with the algorithm you would need and what is computable in a reasonable amount of time. Originally, it was believed that precisely planning an entire economy was hypercomputational until Cockshott pointed out that not all commodities are inputs in the production of other commodities (fur coats aren't involved in producing cars). Keeping this reality in mind, he was able to come up with an algorithm for efficiently performing static allocation in a planned economy. This algorithm has the aforementioned limitation, and it does not address dynamic allocative efficiency (and he just handwaves it away to a central planning agency).

Not according to the wiki, which has the Andromeda launch date sometime between the start of ME2 and ME3. 
Well, the way I accomplished this one, was by searching for the name and birth date of Merriman Shelton, along with his wife's name, on ancestry.com (I have a membership, but this should work for free at a library/university). Not too many records came up via that search, but there were numerous family trees available to look at that others had made. I looked at several different trees, and all of them had unsatisfactory sources for merriman's information. I then looked at the sources they had for his wife, but they were also unsatisfactory. Finally, I looked at the sources given for Merriman's parents, and sure enough, a couple of the trees had a source that listed the information in that index of James Shelton's will. Beyond this I would have tried looking at Merriman's parents in law, his brothers and sisters, and maybe even his children. newlinechar  newlinechar One thing I will say, is that while you cannot add sources to your tree while on ancestry, you can still build one for free and receive hints for free. These hints cannot be viewed directly, but sometimes the contained information is. I do reccomend ancestry libary if you ever get stuck. Just go through and make a list of information you want to find, and then head over one day and look up stuff for a couple hours. I listed some more info in my other post on this thread. Also, ancestry does allow for a two-week free trial, which you should not use until you are well and truly stuck on all branches of your tree, and you will have free time during those two weeks. newlinechar Don't understimate google searches, and try to use pre-existing family trees as building blocks for your own tree only when you are stuck. Let me know if you have any other questions; I must say that I am by no means an expert though, so take my advice as you will!

And it's going to take 5 years to do! newlinechar  newlinechar Yet people like you insist on voting for Labour, Lib Dem or Greens who have **no plan** to solve this.

Yup!
I'm not sure he does have genius-level survival instincts, to be honest. He lies a lot and he uses distractions, but I think it's all very instinctive and impulsive. His survival thus far has been largely due to being insulated by wealth and by people using him for their own agendas, plus an absolute willingness to do pretty much anything to wriggle out of trouble. If he actually had genius survival instincts, he wouldn't routinely say such fucking stupid things (fine people on both sides, idiotic responses to tragedies, etc, etc) when there are *definitely* people willing to advise him on how to give appropriate and non-controversial soundbites.

are you sure you are not thinking of a splitter?  newlinechar  newlinechar A riving knife is a shaped bit of metal curving round ~ 1/3 of the saw blade, in a fixed position just barely removed from the blade - leaving very little/no space for the wood to bind on the blade. The knife raises/lowers and tilts in conjunction with the blade, maintaining that short, fixed distance and height so that it can stay on for 99% of all cuts.  newlinechar  newlinechar I can't think of a way that one of these could be safely retrofitted to a random circ saw - it's just about economically impossible to try and retrofit one of these to a table saw and a circular saw would be much worse. newlinechar  newlinechar A splitter is a small tab of wood/metal that sits in a fixed position and height leaving a large gap between the blade and the splitter depending on the height of the blade, and typically a good chunk of blade well above the splitter (cause the splitter can't be lowered). The splitter needs to be removed for all angled cuts or other cut that it would be in the way for.  newlinechar  newlinechar Whilst it's safer than having nothing at all.... I'd be hesitant to use a well constructed table saw with a splitter, let alone some table mounted circular saw of death and dismemberment =) newlinechar  newlinechar I get you're probably trying to save some $$$, but I'd suggest that when it comes to power tools with sharp blades, you need to look reeeeeal carefully at the costs you are cutting vs the risks you are increasing

Well of course there are always exceptions to every scenario. Nothing in life is simple black and white. Each person is different as well, and even if someone commits a horrific crime, it's possible they could rehabilitate and feel true remorse. newlinechar  newlinechar Resolving to apply one punishment for all crimes and all criminals is a terrible system, and, if I'm not much mistaken, has lead to the ridiculous drug laws and prison overcrowding in the US.

I think most Sorkin scripts guide the direction of the movie, with a big exception being the Social Network which Fincher brought a lot of himself too. I also think its rare for first time directors to have the level of awareness of what the job takes that Sorkin has as he seems pretty involved in the production of his films. IIRC in the q+a at TIFF he said that having Costner there really helped him because of his experience directing and that he consulted him a lot early in the process.

For the Team Leader sets it's divided into AFC and NFC divisions and also teams in their respective division. You add 5 gold 70-74 and 5 gold 75-79 players of whatever team you're working on to get your choice of an 80 overall from that team. There's 5 team leaders from each team, and to complete the set you have to repeat adding the golds 5 times to get them all. Once you have all 5, you complete the 3 elite solos and get your choice of those same 5 Team Leader players but in an 86 overall form this time. You also get to keep all of the 80 overall, or trade in 7 or 8 of them for another 86 overall TL from any team. 
No, because LRC is an open source protocol that's free to use for any exchange, but it is ESPECIALLY powerful for decentralized exchanges. Etherdelta, Bitshares, etc . all suffer from the same problem of low trading volume. Exchanges like that can benefit from using Loopring protocol so that when an order can't be filled on Etherdelta, it can still go through because it will be filled from another DEX. It is, in essence, decentralizing the entire crypto market trading back-end. A DEX is decentralized, but also 'centralized' in the way that each DEX is limited to it's own scope. By utilizing Loopring, Kyber's volume can be linked to Etherdelta, and linked to NEX, and linked to Bitshares, and whatnot.  newlinechar  newlinechar The more cross-exchange trades are being filled by the Loopring protocol, the more transaction fees will need to be paid in LRC. In essense this means the blockchain itself is a market buyer, which buys up LRC tokens by way of transaction fees, which drives the price up as usage grows.  newlinechar  newlinechar A secondary reason why the LRC value will go up is because if participating exchanges want to have a discount on their trading fees (aka, they make more money for per trade), they can stock up on LRC in order to get that. If succesfull this means exchanges will be holding (and therefore not selling) large amounts of LRC in order to maximize their profits. This means large amounts of LRC is taken out of the market supply ('locked up', similar to how masternodes 'lock up' coins), which raises price.

Depends on how you define smart. I think non-psychopaths tend to think being evil is not smart because it only benefits the evil person while doing a great deal of harm in general. In the scheme of things a morally corrupt person is not being smart about continuing the survival of our species, only themselves.  newlinechar  newlinechar So while there is a reason the evil genius character exists, it seems smarter to be a kind genius, since it takes more thought to be selfless than selfish.

That's the key problem with libertarians/propertarians. They think that the state and capitalists are at odds with each other.

Yea there is plenty of violence in the original Last of Us trailers. He'll in one Joel literally drives his truck into several thugs. In another he's fighting off an attacker. The violence in Last of Us 2 wasn't over the top, it was limited and not gratuitous. At least in my opinion.

I enjoy baseball anarchy, but the way I see it, anarchy is only enjoyable when you remember the standard of things going the way they are supposed to.

It had 66% cooldown reduction before. It was always intended to be that way. It's what they were working on MONTHS for in the Heart of Thorns design. newlinechar  newlinechar What was not intended was Chronomancer being able to share 66% cooldown reduction to the entire team. They had it on a few traits because the devs only assumed it would only be a 2s buff on people, not 30 freaking seconds. newlinechar  newlinechar If you make alacrity self-target only, you can have chronomancer fill a more power dps niche by being able to spam his skills significantly faster.

It's natural to hover towards the meta. You were using TB because it's fun, sure. But it's been fun because it's been better than the other options. The spur being the only gun that could pivot is and was very fun to use. But I could never use it because I was always at a disadvantage. And while I did have fun with the TB, I was using it because I was forced to use it. Most Liberator pilots almost exclusively use the TB because it's been so much better than the other guns. It has been the most efficient at doing absolutely everything. It completely made up for its lack of range for DPS.

Yes, all men with progressive views are “nu” males. If you ask me, your problem with political correctness is that it invalidate your bigotry and rightly shuts people like you up in the public domain. There is no room for bigotry in public discourse, this isn’t political correctness, it’s just correctness. Shutting the children up so the adults can figure things out. newlinechar  newlinechar Pretty much just confirming my suspicion. What people mean when they say “they feel silenced by political correctness” really is “My bigoted views are no longer taken serious or given consideration and I don’t feel comfortable expressing them publicly anymore”. There is no requirement for anyone to make you feel comfortable being a bigot. These aren’t conversations we need or want to have.

&gt; Assuming that evidence is valid? He provided a video that literally asked Japanese people, on the streets, what their thoughts on white people wearing Kimonos was. Was it a nation-wide survey of all Japanese people? No. newlinechar  newlinechar You can go on the street and conduct a survey of basically any issue and put together a video that skewed in any direction. There's a reason we take surveys and polls so seriously, there's a reason they're done by scientists and their methodology.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; There was no assumption of what the other person felt in this situation, because he provided a source. There was a firsthand statement, asking them *directly* how they felt about it. And the response was positive. They weren't bothered in the slightest. They felt honored.  newlinechar  newlinechar They aren't the only opinions to be considered either. You can't use the opinions of a few to deem something inoffense to all. The video is useless in determining anything.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: but my last statement wasn't about extrapolating to all Japanese on this case. It was saying, even if all Japanese were okay with it, it's only a single example when cultural appropriation costumes target many different cultures.

1. Nope, just the ring. newlinechar  newlinechar 2. It's not the best, but it's definitely usable. After the first boss in Irithyll, you find some new ashes, and you can buy a Katana that does just as much damage but has a lot more range. The same ashes also unlock Large Titanite in the shop too, and I would definitely recommend getting a +6 weapon before fighting the Irithyll boss. Also get your weapons Sharp infused if you have 25+ Dex. newlinechar  newlinechar 3. It's personal preference, I usually go with the Estus ring.

Personally, I think that the Lone Wanderer is much more versatile than Fawkes.

He could still be eaten alive, and doesn't have the know how to use explosives and traps for self defense while getting supplies.

Unfortunately, like any other profession, on top of being competent, you also have to read/react to people. Building rapport quickly, or having someone that can help your 'brand' counts for a lot.

I feel like a lot of people never even watched the Judah and Devon fight and just take the word of others that it was a robbery. Both were close fights where Lucas was getting outboxed but was also landing big shots to keep him in it.

I know what you mean. It sucks to think that men arent as cared about when it comes to these things and it's true that we arent, but the difference is that violence isn't as prevalent in our real lives as it is for women, so it isn't as triggering/offensive/impactful for us to see it (not speaking on individual experiences, just the stats as a whole.) But yea, I think that all violence, men or women, should be created with a conscious mind. Also, I personally like d the trailer, I think ND uses violence almost as a character and it creates seriously compelling stories and feelings. I like they're use of it knowing the context of the world TLOU is set in. But I also understand why it could be triggering for some.
I have no doubt that this could be done more efficiently. I tried hooking the motor up directly to the switch but it was too fast and broke the thing every time, maybe a gear reduction could get that to work though.

Analogue in Iraqi Kurdistan would be if Iraqi Army actually does a full-scale invasion and occupation of the KRG and forces unemployment on all the peshmerga.  Dunno if that will happen, but at this point who knows what new turns the war will take.   
Yeah, they strip all of them. This can actually be achieved during the acceleration: You could take some lead and electrically strip some electrons, then accelerate them through a carbon target to strip more, accelerate them to a higher speed and send them through an aluminum target to strip the rest.

Heinlein is stretching the truth for the sake of a snappy anecdote. It is true that long before he formalised Scientology, Hubbard would remark to his aquaintences, including Heinlein, the best way to make money would be to start a religion. Now, taken alone, it’s the kind of casual criticism you might hear any secular person say, and indeed you hear similar statements all of the time. In Hubbard’s case, Heinlein sarcastically replied something like “well why don’t you try it, then?”, to which Hubbard jokingly responded “Maybe I *will*”. It only becomes ominous in hindsight. It’s safe to say that Hubbard was already working the idea around in his head long before he ever talked with Heinlein. There was no formal bet. A similar analogue would be the way that Joseph Smith was already struggling with an unusual amount of concern about polygamy in his mind when he wrote the Book of Mormon, even if it the time he denounced it. It’s safe to say that at its very unlikely that Joseph had already consciously started to set his future plans in motion -there’s no way he could have seen that far ahead, and before his successes it was inconceivably impractical. But in hindsight it gives us insight into his unconscious obsessions, which would come to fruition later on when the opportunities for spiritual abuse of power arose. In both cases they were concerns that developed and adapted over years as unforeseen circumstances changed , and not a masterplan that was cautiously meticulously unfurled. If either had that level of prophetic foresight they could have also avoided a lot of the trouble they brought upon themselves. It’s more that they were adept at winging it like they being guided by higher powers when they were really just making it all up as they went along, and their personality and obsessions were expressed in their teachings as they evolved over time.

They do that people always do when they feel attacked (or disagreed with nowadays), they retreat into a close minded state and get defensive, forcing them to deny any and all accusations.  newlinechar  newlinechar But in real life, it's ok if someone realizes they're racist, currently everyone is racist to some extent. Learning how and why your actions and thoughts are caused by systemic racism is key to reducing it. It's important to remember that hierarchical opressive systems like racism don't just affect the oppressed, they also affect the oppressor.

I'm sure. But people who feel this way are almost exclusively on the right. I've been called a liberal tree hugging pussy for expressing any concern for the environment. The person this thread about is clearly anti-science and so unqualified it's absurd to be put in charge of the science at the USDA. He would never have been appointed by a Democrat. This is entirely on Trump and the Republican party. Denying climate change is a party position and sowing distrust of science is a republican talking point.

Clones age at an accelerated rate. This is actually explained in Attack of the Clones. That's why the clones are mature after only 10 years since they were ordered - And in the Rebels show, Rex is an old man even though it takes place 14 years after Revenge of the Sith.
Barclay Els is also pretty good.
I can definitely agree with that. One of my favorite parts about season one was it sort of toed the line between horror and something else while still being a really good show with a lot of great substance and character development and no stupid horror tropes. Season 2 really seems like it departed from horror almost entirely in favor of more character development and more side and back stories. I definitely really liked it but I am kind of salty to see that depart from horror entirely.

If a Russian handed him some dirt on Russia he should have gone straight to the FBI or CIA. Besides, what's the dirt on Clinton you are talking about? She used a personal email address? She got a preview of a debate question? It's already confirmed that members of Trump's administration did (are doing?) the same thing (using personal email accounts). At this point, if there was collusion by trump, the nature of that collusion is moot. He should not be allowed to remain in office.

Speight had a 54% completion percentage and 2 pick sixes in the three games he played before going down. Speight looked this year until he went down and to blame our struggles on an injured QB is just making bullshit excuses. The team wasn't good enough; we had minimal experience at all positions, brand new wide receivers, bad QB play, bad offensive line play all year. Stop making excuses and accept the fact that this wasn't our year; everyone knew it in the preseason so stop trying to change the narrative now. We haven't been good enough this year and we have next year to look forward to. Increased QB development from Peters and Speight, increased line experience, increased RB experience, increased WR experience including getting Black back etc. 
That is, actually, a very tough question.

Brook. The hypothetical here is that for whatever reason they want to retool and know Boogie isn't re-signing.

I just think the emphasis on gold being valuable in, and of, itself doesn't explain why currency is valuable.

The other thing is, the cars likely have dynamic braking, so they only really use the shoes to stop from low speeds. newlinechar  newlinechar Stuff with AC inverter traction motors, can slow to darn near zero speed before they need friction braking.

We started this year at $1,000 and have had ample time to get used to nearly every move of $1,000 up. I won't start getting worried unless we shoot up to $15,000 in the near future.

It's amazing, but I can't speak relatively to the Hornet, I'm not a fan of ballistic guns myself.

The Hornet is a bit slow, so the Scythes slowed down as well, and it was very easy to take them out. If you upgrade to the Sabre, I hope you can take the speed, practice a bit and it will come very handy in the PU.

By linear I mean literal straight corridors were you don't even need to turn, and there aren't even shortcuts, just on 2D parts. Look at Green Hill, Egg Gate and Luminous Forest.

Look how much you have to actually do to actually get the best route. You have things that you can actually hit along the way and stop you on your track. Quickstep, Drifting, Sliding under stuff, even the linear parts are actually fun, cause they have stuff going on, the 2D lnear areas you go running around, looping on rails. The closest they got to this is Egg Gate, but still lacking so much.

It can become actual mass homelessness or life with no ability to pay your most essential bills. Shanty towns or overcrowded squats could make a comeback. newlinechar  newlinechar People who are now food insecure and occasionally reliant on food banks can become persistently hungry and reliant on soup kitchens. newlinechar  newlinechar People who now choose between bills and use payday loans to make ends meet could become people who can't pay the most essential bills, the ones they rely on for the necessities of life rather than the necessities of civic participation.  newlinechar  newlinechar You can live without electrical lighting, without telecommunications (though it makes all else more difficult), without entertainment beyond your imagination, but heat in a cold snap is essential, as is water for drinking and cleaning. newlinechar  newlinechar Rolling brownouts and blackouts could return so that even paying for electricity won't always get it. The fuel supply would be less stable and shortages harder to make up, so petrol and gas prices may be more erratic and crises more frequent. newlinechar  newlinechar If you think things can't get worse, your imagination is rather limited and I hope desperately that reality never shows you otherwise.

So what seems to stop you from doing a foot supported l-sit? Do you feel like one specific part of your body isn't strong enough? newlinechar  newlinechar Some people have issues with scapular depression, in other words pushing the shoulders down like you do in an l sit. If this is the case, I would encourage you to work on the parallel bar support from the skill work section of the RR, focusing on really pushing your shoulders down away from your ears as you hold yourself up, and you should have a foot supported l-sit in no time. newlinechar  newlinechar If it's your abs that are too weak, then practice the planks that are in the bodyline drills section of the RR. They're not super specific to building strength for the l-sit, but if you can hold a 30 second to one minute plank, then you are definitely strong enough to do a foot supported l-sit. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar If you're already good with both the parallel bar support and the plank, then the only other thing I can think of is posting a form check. Also, check out Antranik's video about the l-sit progression found here:   newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar  https://youtu.be/IUZJoSP66HI newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar It's very helpful, and sometimes, all it takes is seeing someone else do it right.

Eeeeh, that's kind of not true. Sure they put together some social programs to appeal to the worker class, but a lot of those were shams. Not to mention several capitalist countries also had social programs by that time.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example the whole Volkswagen beetle car was a scam, no one ever got one despite full stamp books. Standards of living for the working class actually decreased under Nazism when compared to the Weimar Republic and rationing was tightened, even before the war. newlinechar  newlinechar The Nazi party was very concerned with making big business happy, and a lot of the slave labor was lent out to industries such as Krupp, IG Farben, Porsche and so on. These industries got filthy rich off of the war (until it all came crashing down). Party and business elites had lavish lifestyles that even the Soviet nomenklatura wouldn't even dare dream about.  newlinechar  newlinechar Industry wasn't really nationalized either, but they did tighten some controls, insofar as it concerned the war effort. Nothing really different than what the US and other countries did during the war. Ideologically, they pretended to be socialists, but in actuality, the Nazi party was a military junta allied to a corporatocracy.

Article 347 is open to interpretation, and the Supreme Court ruled in Maduro's favor.

It does not say that there must **three elections**: first to convene, then to elect, then to approve. the fact that the CA will go through **two direct elections** already makes it the most (formally) democratic way of changing the constitution in world history, *with the exception of the 1999 Constitution* (which went through tree direct elections). It is certainly more democratic than Chavez's 2007 plebiscite, which he lost. newlinechar And the 1999 referendum is not a legal precedent because the the referendum occurred before the Bolivarian constitution was adopted.

You and me are oceans away here. I HATE that Obama ushered in socialist policies and rhetoric that have opened the door for its further advancement. Ideas can be poison, once the seed is planted it’s hard/ impossible to contain. I never imagined the likes of Bernie Sanders would have a legitimate platform in the US.

Talking negatively of Barry in any form is immediately met with remarks of “racism” or “bigotry.” He was the perfect storm to introduce the ideology he adores.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you think Obamacare isn’t a big deal then you have not dealt with insurance from a business planning perspective, or at least small/midsize.

&gt; Of course it's profitable to mine. If it wasn't profitable, no one would be mining. newlinechar  newlinechar Let me rephrase, if you're buying equipment now to mine, it is unprofitable. It will simply take too much time to make back you're money. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What you mean to say is that the risk-reward equation has tilted away from investing in new hardware, due to the long time expected for recouping initial investments. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't understand what you're saying here. Risk/Reward has moved from new hardware to what? newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; That said, even this logic is faulty. You don't need to make back the entire cost of your hardware to be profitable; you just need to mine more than the depreciation of said hardware. This of course, applies to everyone, even those whose hardware has already been paid off. newlinechar  newlinechar Are you trying to say that once mining has become unprofitable, you'll start to unload your 10+ GPUs and worthless CPUs and  mobos and PSUs and when other miners are going to be selling their equipment? It's not a good plan to fall back on.  newlinechar  newlinechar This has been my sentiment for a while, and will continue to be this way. **If you haven't started, you will not reliably get your money back** However, if you want to mine because it's a hobby, a personal pc, or have already started, then feel more welcomed to continue mining.

If you have $5,000 in your brokerage, you may be able to buy stocks with $10,000 for a monthly fee.  The brokerage will let you invest with more money so hopefully you can make more money and they get some interest on the side.   newlinechar  newlinechar However, if your investments decline by 75%, you would lose $3,750 if you invested only with your money or you would lose $7,500 if you had your money and the brokerage’s money.  Then you would owe the brokerage $2,500.   newlinechar  newlinechar Normally they will send a margin call to you meaning you have sell some stuff to pay back the brokerage for your losses.  Unfortunately for that dude, the stock he was in tanked after hours so the brokerage couldn’t sell his stocks to pay them back.  This means he now owes the brokerage all of the money he lost.

I responded to them, but no, I haven't because I have actually just been tracking one network of users. With the exception of one that I chose randomly from the front page, I have only been looking into accounts that commented on the posts of users who I already looked into. It all started with Sineseta.  newlinechar  newlinechar The only reason it is overwhelmingly skewed towards t_d is because that is the place they are taking their posts and comments from. I assume it would be harder to find leftist posters here because they have 1) already been banned, 2) are insta-downvoted and can't gain traction anyways, and 3) the subs they use, like politics, don't allow editorializing of headlines (the main way I've caught what these users are doing) newlinechar  newlinechar Also, as some people pointed out.

I could've worded that better. If you don't pick up any items you will not get any of the points that are awarded for surviving (called rank points). You get points for hitting people proportionate to the damage dealt (hit points) and 20 points for each person you deal the finishing blow to (kill points?). You can end up hitting and killing someone or multiple people, but die without picking up any items which leaves you with no rank points.

You're right on the gem price, I was looking at the wrong column. I'll note here that unless you're wanting the full story, LS2 is generally considered not as worth it as LS3 due to having weak rewards and access to Dry Top/Silverwastes already. LS3 gives much better rewards with stat-selectable (of everything pre-PoF) Ascended trinkets, another Mastery track, and the maps. newlinechar  newlinechar And yeah, for anything less than rare you'll generally make more money from salvaging them for materials than you do directly selling them. Also for champion bags you get if you open them on a 40-50 character the gear will be that level, so the salvage will be more valuable to sell on the TP (T2-T4 materials are needed in a lot of crafting but are obtained less often).

Regarding “they” - that usage has been common in English for hundreds of years.  Old school grammarians would say that it is improper (and that you should use “he” or “he or she”) and I would therefore recommend that you avoid it in formal writing. On reddit, with friends, in informal emails, go for it.  I personally like it, and since it was good enough for Shakespeare, it is good enough for me.   newlinechar  newlinechar It sounds like you used “as in” correctly. In this context, it means “meaning” — “ID, as in (meaning) identification?” It functions similarly in, “you want me to go out with you, as in (meaning), a date?”   It is also commonly used when spelling out words, to help differentiate between letters that sound the same.  For instance, “My name is Tom - T as in ‘television’, O, M as in ‘Mike’”.   newlinechar  newlinechar Hope that helps.  newlinechar  newlinechar

Cave Story has mostly simple environments and spritework that, aside from some bosses, is intentionally somewhere in between NES and SNES levels of complexity.  It has an aesthetic that works for it, but it isn't comparable to Bloodstained.  Not in the sense that one is better than the other though.  I mean there really are no meaningful points of comparison between the two.  You couldn't improve one by making it like the other because they aren't trying to be anything even remotely like each other. newlinechar  newlinechar The same goes for most of the games that people are trying to compare it to.  With some exceptions(e.g. Cuphead, Ori and the Blind Forest), most indie platfomers have to try for an aesthetic that incorporates simple elements because making something with the visual complexity of Symphony of the Night would be too expensive.  Even SotN was only possible because the bulk of the heavy lifting from an artwork standpoint had already been done in games prior. newlinechar  newlinechar Bloodstained is trying to capture a similar feel to IGA's Castlevania games.  Not retro 8-bit or 16-bit games.  Not super-stylized art styles that allow the developer to take advantage of a lower requirement for detail to achieve their aesthetic.  And pixel art at the level of SotN was never an option with their budget.  There's just no point in trying to complain about a game not looking more like an aesthetic that the developers weren't trying to emulate in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar Do I think that Bloodstained's visuals could be improved?  Absolutely.  More could be done with the shaders to get the backgrounds looking more like the art style that they used for the characters, for one.  I've brought this concern on the official forums more than once.  But the only games I'm using to judge Bloodstained by are itself and the Castlevania games it seeks to emulate.  Anything else is really just pointless.

Macros in game could help set up saying things in game, like how DBM works. A raid lead could set it up to say certain things when abilities and whatnot go out.

Right but effective currency cannot be finite supply. That promotes even more wealth centralization and monopolization, and makes for a bad currency.

I don't think it is. It's an interesting look into the mind of a kid who lost his brother, suffers from survivor's guilt, saw a kid commit suicide and grapples with clinical depression without anybody to reach out to--and the one time he does, he's creeped on by an old professor of his. It's about the mind of a broken person in a place all of us have been, or will be at some point. It's about despair and the vulnerability all of us have, even if we deny it or bury it in our attitude. To me, it represents the importance of reaching out to those in need, even if we don't think they deserve it.

Either way it’s a pretty color on you :) I think you might be over-analyzing it- I do that with my own hair. Anyway, disclaimer: I am by no means a professional, I only have my own hair dye escapades (and late nights spent googling hair dying) as reference. Someone correct me if I’m wrong but I think that a remover would lighten your base hair color which would be similar to what bleach does. I think it would work and bring you to a point where you can add “fresh” color over it but would probably be pretty damaging I think if it were me I’d opt for putting a similarly colored semi-permanent on top of what you have before trying to strip the color with removers. Semi-permanent dyes (manic panic, Adore, Lime Crime come to mind) don’t harm your hair very much as far as I know.

If they were just cuttings with no roots you shouldn’t water them at all until they have roots. Fresh cuttings also need time to heal and callous where they were cut so you shouldn’t plant them until the cut is dry and not soft. If they don’t have roots then there’s no real way for them to take up water. How long have they been in wet soil? And what kind of soft leaves are they? Are they yellowing or are they the normal color? (Also if you have pics that would be good) But yes, I’d pull the plants out and let them sit out to dry if you’re concerned about rot; it’s always better to be safe and check for signs of rot cause it spreads pretty quickly if left unchecked. newlinechar Most big store brand cactus soils don’t have enough inorganic material in it so you should mix in sand or perlite or pumice to help with drainage (I’m partial to perlite since it’s cheap and light and doesn’t make the soil compact over time). Usually a 1:1 mix of soil to perlite is good; I can send you a pic of my mixed soil for reference if you’d like.

There are quite a bit of issues with Capcom support on the switch so I'll try to keep it brief. newlinechar The first main issue is their refusal to bring new games to the switch that could definitely run on the switch, with the most notable missing titles being Mega Man Legacy Collection and Okami HD.  newlinechar  newlinechar Their second main issue  is their refusal to localize their games for the western audience i.e. see Monster Hunter XX. newlinechar  newlinechar Their third  issue, more of a general complaint rather than a switch specific complaint, is most of their recent catalog has been ports or barebone games. Monster Hunter World does look interesting, but, it won't be available for the switch. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I inaccurately said that Phantasy Star Online was Capcom property. It's Sega property. Thanks for correcting me /u/darkredninja
thats amazing thank you

Yea I agree with you, go for Coinomi

I think he was asking if it was known BEFORE Monday.
Don’t stress out too much. You’re trying to have a back and forth with “bootycrusade” who recently posted in showerthoughts “why aren’t porn websites .cum?”
&gt; So your saying we can't actually use anything to justify actual showings. newlinechar &gt; Your right, goku can't bust a universe because that universe has no feats and we can't assume it would be anywhere near our universe so honestly I'll lowball it to at least planetary. newlinechar &gt; Also because they are literally from two entirely different timelines and not the same timeline. Which is entirely what matters here. newlinechar  newlinechar No... What thats not what I said at all. You are strawmanning my argument. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Two people from two different timelines interacting is a-ok because they aren't the same being newlinechar Two people from the same timeline interacting or existing in the same space is not okay at all because it's a giant paradox. newlinechar  newlinechar No because the series like I said explicitly treats them as separate people. Once again. You know what lets attack this head on. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;**Bootstrap paradox**, (also ontological paradox) Can a time traveler send himself information with no outside source? newlinechar **Polchinski's paradox**: A billiard ball can be thrown into a wormhole in such a way that it would emerge in the past and knock its incoming past self away from the wormhole entrance, creating a variant of the grandfather paradox. newlinechar **Predestination paradox:** A man travels back in time to discover the cause of a famous fire. While in the building where the fire started, he accidentally knocks over a kerosene lantern and causes a fire, the same fire that would inspire him, years later, to travel back in time. The bootstrap paradox is closely tied to this, in which, as a result of time travel, information or objects appear to have no beginning. newlinechar **Temporal paradox:** What happens when a time traveler does things in the past that prevent him from doing them in the first place? newlinechar **Grandfather paradox:** You travel back in time and kill your grandfather before he conceives one of your parents, which precludes your own conception and, therefore, you couldn't go back in time and kill your grandfather. newlinechar **Hitler's murder paradox:** You travel back in time and kill a famous person in history before they become famous; but if the person had never been famous, then he could not have been targeted as a famous person. newlinechar  newlinechar These are all paradoxes from wikipedia and while it would be egregious to use it in normal circumstances it's all right here because you're asserting the claim. At no point is it ever mentioned the multiverse theory that meeting your past self is a paradox. All of these are solved by dragonball multiverse theory world building

Ok, but compare that to Christianity where the Old Testament isn't even touched on, even remotely in more than like 90% of churches.

If you haven’t installed something like Let’s Encrypt/Certbot, you should be fine on that front. newlinechar  newlinechar The Web Interface settings show Pi-hole’s currently configured IP address, and you need to compare this to the likes of `ifconfig` from Terminal.

probably not much. different producers make different products. comes down to personal preference of the consumer. crown royal is produced locally and they dont exactly have a monopoly on whiskey sales. same could be said about any of the local brewers. maybe at first delta nine will control a big part of it but after a while...not so much

It was a loooong and arduous conversation in the mod chat.

It's so good! I'm so glad they put it on Netflix, so much easier to watch than finding links for each ep 
The classic example of this misconception is how so many Japanese architects put vents in the sides of the concrete foundations of timber frame houses. They think the vents are necessary to ventilate the floor timber to prevent rot, when in fact all those vents do is allow warm, wet air under the house, which proceeds to condense on the cool floor timber. Building scientists have demonstrated this effect many times, showing that an absence of vents is healthier for the structure. Yet many architects still insist on putting the vents in.
That got me thinking and I realised maybe there should be a wider variety of songs on the album. It’s mostly garage punk, but I’m trying to fuse it with genres from my native country Brazil, and I guess that the listening experience will only be enhanced by more tracks, as it means more variety in styles. I guess I’m leaning more towards seven now, thanks
Just read your other comments. Ugh, I think you losing this roommate would be the best thing in the world. Would you consider moving into a new unit? It sounds like this girl cares about no one other than herself, which spells trouble for a roommate situation.

i wandered around the middle of the map all season why was i not in voting for two way ball
Partially agree. newlinechar the increased barrel length SHOULD increase velocity of this ammo type but the form factor of this ammo is also not designed for penetration in most variants. A partial increase in velocity would not allow a smaller, rounded tip projectile to pierce armor.  newlinechar  newlinechar with that said however i do believe that some ammo types should be affected more adversely by the longer barrel then others (i.e a steel core projectile may just punch through armor with a higher velocity where as a hollow point would still just crumble)

Great insights! Really cool to get your thoughts.
I can barely find 2 other people to do a strike with.  Where would I find 999 other people to PvP? newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously though, that would be a really fun IB game mode.  You get put onto a permanent team and for a week one of the planets is a PvP battleground.  You can come and go as you please, but you always go back onto your initial team.  Constantly gaining points, and every so often you get rewards based off if your team is winning or losing and how you personally did for that time period.  At the end the winning team gets something and the losing team can buy it (similar to faction rallies)

Building a PC with console graphics would be like $500, better tha  console cos no overheating issues and you'll maintain the 60fps at all times.

The tower stuff to unlock parts of the map were way to Ubisoft, the final fight sucked, as cool as the beasts were it’s still the same ol  “oh save me Link” also ganon is back again.  newlinechar  newlinechar It’s gorgeous game for being under powered compared to what RPG’s are out and I love the changes to armor and what you can equip.  newlinechar  newlinechar I know it’s a big deal for a Zelda game to be open world but it wasn’t anything new that really shook me like open world games in the past have.  newlinechar  newlinechar It sits at at a solid 8.5 for me. I still recommend it to everyone.

Oh right.

I know a lot of people who joined the reserves just for the tuition reimbursement. newlinechar  newlinechar So if that's your motivation to join, and last I heard there's like 20K reservists, it can help explain why so many soldiers, reserves or otherwise, have degrees. newlinechar  newlinechar Whereas if I'm not mistaken, in the US you get education paid for after serving, or after doing a tour or something to that effect.

So then you would have no problem with an ad with people wearing shirts from a Democratic candidate roaming a campus in a mob and attacking students? Or set the same ad you have no issue with in a major city, change the flag to the Isis flag, and put a DNC bumper sticker on it? Of course you would have a problem, as should anyone, regardless of their party, have a problem with the DNC ad that ran. It’s one thing to tar a candidate with a broad brush, it’s another to go after their supporters.  newlinechar  newlinechar That’s the problem with being blindly partisan, you can’t see what’s right or wrong unless the wrong is being done to your side, but by that point your own hands are dirty so you have no case to cry. 
For the No Squad Upgrade you still might want to consider it on Vanilla so long as you're on PC.  On PC you can draw the Avatars out to the house on the other side of the bridge (in WotC you're locked in the small room on the other side of the bridge).  Makes it easier, especially with a Sniper who can use Squad Sight to shoot them from across the bridge which often teleporter them closer to the squad (I used a stealth Ranger who didn't reveal himself until the final Avatar). newlinechar  newlinechar I used one of each of the base classes and it worked well.  Though I also combined this with Exquisite Timing or else I would have swapped out the Specialist for a Psi.  And with a Psi you can bring a Dominated Gatekeeper into the final fight while in WotC you lose any MCed units (to include the zombies).

I haven't played either in a long time. What I remember from the Genesis is text wall after text wall versus story being told in in-game cut scene type actions. I always liked that better. If you really want to play shadowrun, you should play the remake on PC at this point. It's pretty fantastic.

Maybe that hypothetical Arcane half-caster, for example.

&gt;&gt;If someone is already pirating, what would ever make them want to start paying money. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't know about you, but the fact that I don't have to find a seeded torrent (which for older anime is especially terrible), or deal with any number of subpar video hosts would be a huge plus in my book. Especially if I don't have to fuck around with my PC mouse while I'm not at my desk via smartphone. This goes *double* for anything that is remastered that will never be uploaded because it's super niche. Hell, I already pay funimation $60 for that reason. The fact I can use my TV remote and that I don't have to manually change episodes all add a ton of value to me, and I still pirate regularly. While funimation has been mostly stable the past 5 or so months (as of the latest iteration of their app) prior to that it was fucking nightmarish and I did ask myself why I was paying them. I still don't *love* their service, but at least they've made visible measurable improvements. Dragonball Super crashing their servers for 109-110 for almost 24 hours was also unacceptable so they need work on their backend too. I don't know if I'm renewing in January but don't kid yourself, there are plenty of ways that these services can add value to themselves that people will pay for, we are talking about $6-$10 a month they don't have to do much besides make sure shit is stable and make sure their content delivery is simple.

I have literally never seen anybody reading in a crowded bar. That just seems strange and exceedingly uncommon to me. The lighting is dark. The crowd is noisy.

He's made some adjustments (better ground-and-pound, better hand parries, better footwork), but he's still fundamentally the same guy who makes himself susceptible to the same things. Rory comprehensively solved Woodley's style and there's no reason to assume GSP can't replicate the same strategy. Woodley is also 35, and while he doesn't have a lot of miles on him, he's not young. I've said before, Woodley is more stylistically akin to Koscheck than Hendricks. So, GSP via jab-heavy decision.

Yeah it's a pretty normal reaction when you create something, especially with such a time crunch.

No worries, dude. If you do apply, go for the Used Dept. You get to play with a ton of great gear, both new and old. newlinechar  newlinechar When I first started working there, we were on a separate floor from the rest of the store. Didn't have to wear vests or uniforms, and it felt a bit like working in Empire Records. As the store expanded, it started to feel a bit more like a traditional job - all the same, it was still a great gig.
&gt;Trait A is exceptionally prevelant. It is reasonable to assume then that trait A has provided some benefit or has some survival value. newlinechar  newlinechar This right here is just plain wrong. Just because a trait survives long enough to be passed down genetically doesn't mean it necessarily has value or benefit to that creatures survival in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm happy to have cleared up this misconception for you. If you have any more evolution related questions you could go to ask science or to a more relevant debate sub.

G2's first LCS split (which they won) was Kikis, Trickz, Perkz, Emperor, Hybrid. Trickz ended up winning MVP but he came into the scene as basically a Kr soloq star, Perkz also was a rookie. Not sure who on that team you would call by far the two best players in the league at that point in time. 
Though that is certainly understandable, as I presume (should that indeed be the reason) the concern then falls to an equitable allocation of development time, this is technically a feature which escapes the capabilities of lootshare - and, as I understand it, groupshare as well. newlinechar  newlinechar Lootshare necessitates that, as an effect of its use, drops which are received from a boss *must* be redistributed amongst the party members. This occurs with respect to each player's lootshare points (LSP), which are decided by the drops they either receive or miss while in other parties using lootshare. This can be - and has been - problematic, as drop sniping has occurred before by missing a few high-value items (especially when Vorago was released) and then joining larger groups/masses - the lootshare sees that you have a great deficit of loot, and gives some to you. newlinechar  newlinechar Though this can be useful, and the difference is negligible among groups of friends who know and trust each other well, it doesn't always play out fairly in other circumstances. Because we don't want drops redistributed, or our LSP to be affected, a friend and I might duo Nex and split drops - but I have to take his word for it when he says that he got torstol seeds instead of onyx bolts (e). newlinechar  newlinechar I'm certainly not disagreeing with you - I voted in favor of it too - but I just wished to explain why, if it was used as a reason, it isn't the best one. I thought initially that chat spam might have been a deterrent, or other curious players joining into areas or instances to look at the drop notifications, but surely it could be filtered if this would become problematic enough to warrant a filter.
Ha that's funny. They only get a share from gifts they know about, by-the-book John. 
I mean that's completely up to what you want personally.  If the Switch had a lineup worth buying I would have bought one but it doesn't right now.  The fact that it is portable literally does nothing to move the needle with me as I A.) don't travel a lot for work and B.) When I leave the house I'm not leaving to play video games somewhere else.   newlinechar  newlinechar I would buy an XboxOne or PS4 100 times out of 100 right now because the lineups are better and it has more features in which I personally want.  Also, you are definitely in the very, very, very, small minority of people who would buy 2 of the same consoles for a house. newlinechar  newlinechar I get what you are saying about overlap between the XBone and PS4 and that people aren't really that likely to buy both of them but I also believe that people that play XBone and PS4 aren't as big of Nintendo gamers.  I do have a PS4 and Xbone though as I use both of them as media consoles in 2 different rooms which is something I would never buy a Switch for.
I am BEAR, but why does that make a difference, just out of interest?

Epic, dude. Simply epic.
Islam might be growing due to birth rates, but not by adopters. My timescale is plenty because the Industrial Revolution, or perhaps the Renaissance, marked a transition unseen in human history. The science that we’ve uncovered and technology we’ve invented since then may be greater than all of human history before that. If we see there is a stark increase in the proportion of atheists, than that’s quite significant. Evolution is not very continuous, but more so discrete jumps.

Because, quite frankly, I do not want to.  That would make me miserable.

They don't suffer.  We don't even let them get scared before we kill them, because it ruins the meat. newlinechar  newlinechar The only time my people have recorded eating only veggies, was when we had to survive off bitterroot because all the animals couldn't be found.  We still hold a ceremony to celebrate them surviving that rough winter, every spring, where we only eat bitterroot. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't want to argue this though, I've viewed the comments here and am content with the fact that we simply disagree;  I don't think that owning chickens is nearly the same thing has slavery.

Here's a link to [a Steam community page](https://steamcommunity.com/games/steamvrtracking/announcements/detail/1264796421606498053) that confirms the asymmetric backwards compatibility. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Because the new Valve-built base stations don’t include a sync blinker, one side-effect of the sync-on-beam technology in tracking 2.0 is that those base stations will only work with TS4231-based devices. Valve-built base stations will not work with older 1.0 devices. The older 1.0 base stations will continue to work with new devices, just without any of the new features. newlinechar  newlinechar Which to be honest is the only backwards compatibility I really need.

Problem with KB is that he wasn't consistently special. Looked phenomenal in a few games this season but then looked like an undrafted FA at others. He doesn't consistently runs good routes and doesn't consistently use his physical tools to create separation. I think he'll look a lot better in Buffalo where he isn't force fed the ball. Lots of people are making it seem as if Carolina has given up on the season, but I think losing Kelvin might actually help Cam as a QB. We were forcing it to Kelvin at times as if he was Calvin Johnson or something and it wasn't working out, we were due for a change.

Blankets are great fun - and they’re especially nice to make in winter, since they can keep you warm past a certain size.

The left would probably accuse Donald Trump of orchestrating their assassinations to protect himself, meanwhile, the right would accuse the deep state of getting rid of them because their testimony would vindicate Donald Trump. newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, it would send this whole thing into a tailspin and it would be impossible to connect the Russian Government to a well-orchestrated assassination, so there wouldn't be any more political blowback than there was for Litvinenko, Politkovskaya, Mikhail Lesin or any of the other assassinations which the FSB likely conducted. newlinechar  newlinechar The entire goal of the Russians in colluding with officials on Donald Trump's campaign was not to put a patsy in the White House. Instead, it was to make American's lose faith in their government and weaken America on an international level. Killing Manafort and Papadopoulos would be the ultimate move at ths point...

If you have high ping, you'll obviously have trouble against an equivalent enemy in a fair fight. A more sustain-y build would probably suit. Perhaps Necromancer, Celestial Elementalist, Spellbreaker would be good.  newlinechar  newlinechar The better way is to find a commander and join teamspeak/discord and listen and follow along. If you're interested then you can join the guild or continue pugging with them. This is the best way to experience WvW even if you just want a few buddies to roam. The best friend to having 250 ping is finding a buddy/group that can fill in when your ping starts hurting. newlinechar  newlinechar This also follows onto the Thief/Mes/Warrior roamer issue. You will find it difficult to kill them solo, since they are solo roamers built to gank out of position enemies. The best anti-thief/roamer build is bringing a few friends. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to solo/duo roam and want to counter thieves, usually Dragonhunters are seen as a hard counter (put down traps that reveal/one-shot the thief if they dive), Warrior/Spellbreaker can probably manhandle them (like everyone else), Mesmers can just blink like thieves and put heavy condition pressure on them if specc'd for it/Invis bomb them with power builds (but then you're at risk of getting one-shotted). Engineers can place turrets and use other defensive tools to bunker very well against thieves. newlinechar  newlinechar The problem with fighting thieves solo is that they can usually run away if they lose. So it's usually pointless to fight them; and they probably won't fight you unless they are sure they can win. newlinechar  newlinechar Summary for annoying thieves: newlinechar  newlinechar - Bunker builds to not get one-shot and lock down a 'safe zone' that they have to take big risks to enter (DH traps, Engi turrets, damaging AOE fields) newlinechar  newlinechar - Abilities that apply Revealed to take thieves out of stealth newlinechar  newlinechar - Heavy condition pressure will make them back off, since they usually don't have big amounts of cleanse and are very squishy. newlinechar  newlinechar - Run with an ally or close enough for allies to get to you. You'll probably not be able to catch a good thief unless an ally can meet them to finish them off as they are escaping.

To play Devil's Advocate her. We all roasted Hurney for giving players the loyalty bonus that led us to cap hell, and rightfully so. This is essentially the opposite. This off season would have meant cutting KB and getting nothing for him, and him entering a crowded receiving market on the back of what was shaping up to be another year where his production dropped. Or keeping him and losing someone else. newlinechar  newlinechar Keeping KB, despite his cost and lack of fit in an offense that has invested in players that excel in the short to intermediate passing ranges where Benji struggles, would have really put us in a tight cap spot with Star and Norwell both on the block and Shaq Thompson heading into the 4th year of his contract and players behind him needing reps to diversify our offense. With our only major losses likely to be Adams and JStew. The math doesn't really add up, especially if we expect the team to do anything in free agency, like, idk, get another safety. Or a running back. Or a center. Or a TE. And so forth.  newlinechar  newlinechar So then other people have to get the axe along with him. One of those is Funch, who has shown growth as a player while KB has been pretty stagnant. I don't see JPep walking away while he's still productive, so you might have to tell him no. Still doesn't make room for KB's contract alongside Norwell, Star, and Shaq. Assuming we let JStew walk as his contract expires, do you want to keep CAP? Cause he's gonna cost more now that he's not on his rookie contract. Do you go to TD and tell him to retire if he's still feeling it? What about Ryan Kalil after two years of injuries? Are you prepared to go with Tyler Larsen?  newlinechar  newlinechar Either way, keep or cut Benji, someone at the very least leaves for nothing, and I'd put the other people in line for paydays miles ahead of Benji in importance. His contract isn't great, so we were never going to get a player for player trade. The rest of the WRs on the market were definitively better than him. So, at the end of the day, we got something where we would have gotten nothing and made space for other young players to get more chances.

Well, in that case, I'll repeat a rule of thumb that I hear is rather popular in the publishing industry: your first five books are going to suck. It's the five books after that when you're going to really get good. That's what Brandon Sanderson tends to say, anyhow. I hope I won't have to write five books before I become a decent writer, personally, but at least it's something inspiring and encouraging to look up to right? :P

Gerrymandering is only effective in typical election years. The point is to have just enough people in your party in a district spread over many districts, with the opposition being crammed into much fewer districts. newlinechar    newlinechar During wave elections (like 2018 will be with an unpopular president in a midterm), this can go horribly wrong. The many gerrymandered districts can be flipped when they are only slightly in favor of the defending party. The tactic works until these wave elections come along and completely fuck the incumbent party in a gerrymandered district. I think 2018 will go decisively for the Dems in the House. The Senate is less likely, but crazier things have happened. Look who's sitting in the White House.

He didn't do it because they were selling goods and sacrifices, he did it because the Sadducees were taking advantage of the people who had to travel far during passover. newlinechar  newlinechar The Jews considered Roman coinage almost like idolatry (graven image of Roman leaders?) so using Roman money inside the temple was a big no-no. To allow people who traveled from distant places to buy an animal for sacrifice in the Temple, however, money exchanges were set up so you could get special Temple coinage. Like what happens in a lot of situations where someone has a monopoly on goods, the price was increased to be outrageously high. Along with that the vendors of sacrificial animals could also charge extremely high prices. So you end up with poor people having to pay many times more for a single animal than what they should have.  newlinechar  newlinechar TL;DR The abuse of the poor is what upset Jesus, not the buying and selling of goods.

The post-refresh W204 C250 and C300 aren't going to perform appreciably differently in day-to-day driving (such as commuting and Uber/Lyfting), simply because the turbocharged 1.8L engine of the C250 is a newer design with a robust/wide torque band. The C300 is also offered exclusively as a 4Matic, meaning it'll be heavier. At such, MB states the same 0-60 numbers for both C250 and C300, with the C250 having a bonus of being more fuel efficient. Thus in my opinion, it's really about the C250 versus the C350 (that is more than a second faster 0-60). newlinechar  newlinechar The wife and I test-drove the W204 C250 and C350, before buying a W205 C300. The newer W205, despite still being a turbocharged 4-banger (enlarged to 2.0L), felt at least as fast as the C350, even if it's a touch slower in testing. The new 2.0L is also surprisingly frugal, and she occasionally saw close to 40mpg for the trip, driving conservatively and doing the speed limit. If your budget allows that stretch, you may want to investigate that too. newlinechar  newlinechar Issue-wise, I understand the '12-14 C-klasse are pretty sorted, with no major problems. The M271 (1.8L turbo) and M276 (3.5L V6) are both reputed to be reliable. If you get a '14, you may even be able to get a factory 3-year extended warranty. Nevertheless, as with all used cars, be sure to establish that the candidate was taken good care of during its lifetime.

&gt;One may be wrathful with that which one has created, but ultimately one must reconcile that sin (anger) and accept it as part of oneself to truly have power over it. newlinechar  newlinechar Man is made in the image of God.  Anything a man feels God may feel.  There are many metaphors in the Bible.  For example, in Ezekiel 23 Israel and Judah are like two sister God married.  They prostituted themselves with foreign nations and foreign idols.  God's Anger is slow.  He gives man time to repent.  He sent prophets to warn people.  (Ezekiel 33)  Eventually God brought his Judgment on Israel and Judah.  God, as a Judge, works in particular ways.  There is particular criteria he makes his Judgements on.   newlinechar  newlinechar Part of growing in Faith, is learning who God is, and working to tune one's Thumos or Character to God's character.

As a fan of the incredibles I am deeply offended. How can I not obsess about how PERFECT the incredibles is. For example, when Syndrome confidently strides towards his cool manta ray plane after easily overpowering the entire Incredibles family he wipes the snot from his nose. The level of detail I swear. I feel the writers could’ve just made him this bland villain like most superhero movies nowadays but no, they decided to make him flawed, compelling, and human. This movie is the essence of perfection, something far better than anything else fictitious or real. I own five blue ray copies of the incredibles even tho I don’t have a blue ray DVD player. I pray to these copies every night and ask that the world be more like the incredibles canon. Maybe I wouldn’t be so obsessed if everyone was a cartoon animated character. Do you ever think about that Kaila? Maybe I can’t talk about anything besides the incredibles because that film is just too perfect. As a true intellectual nihilist I can tell you that nothing is of value except the incredibles. I watched a couple YouTube videos about Niche so trust me I am of a much higher intellectual capacity than you are and since I am smarter in all regards my opinion is greater than yours. Everything is pointless except the incredibles. Wake up sheeple
Yeah, that train of thought it basically exactly why I don't draw rainbows on the covers. It's a totally unfair judgement, but people make it, so... adjust and account for it I guess. I'll go stand in the corner and feel a little dirty and defeated for giving in.

Oh by no means are they immortal. Some of them did go down easy when the Germans arrived, *however* that was due to the Germans wielding firearms that the Amazons hadn't encountered before. They didn't know how to counter or combat enemies with guns. Even then their losses were minimal. The Gerudos don't have any trump card like guns to play, being limited to practically the same weaponry as the Amazons with far less experience, inferior physical abilities, and no archers (I believe their marksmen were spear wielders and no archers were present).  If you gave Gerudos horses, the Ice Arrows (which they have possession of) and Iron Knuckles (Spirit Temple guardians traditionally tied to the Gerudos) then they'd stand a better chance.  newlinechar  newlinechar But as things stand, Amazons are basically stronger and faster Gerudos with 100x the lifespan to train with.

It’s like you know the answer but you don’t say it. Even distribution of power in Congress was absolutely the issue... but that was directly tied to slavery... as per the Missouri compromise.  newlinechar  newlinechar Seriously, please come up with a good definition of what “the south” was without using slavery. “The South” is not a geographic term moreso a term that separated slaveholding states between non slave holding states. It’s stupid to think that all of these states that really cared about states rights also just so happened to be almost every single slave holding state. States rights was NOT an issue exclusive to southern states, Northern states quarreled over issues over states rights just as the South did, but there was only one “right” that people were willing to go to such extremes protect. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, they were absolutely fearful of political isolation and disenfranchisement - because a great portion of their economy AND social institutions were standing on the foundation of a practice that was dying worldwide. Yeah, they saw the writing on the wall and did the only thing they could do to protect their “peculiar institution”.  newlinechar  newlinechar Just take every single point you have and take it one step further. The power they feared from the Federal government only caused fear because they believed it marked an end to slavery. But for the love of god, don’t take my word for it.

China's economic boom of the past 30 years (which is actually slowing down to the point that it may reach US growth in the next 10 years) saw them grow more heavily invested in US exporting, US debt, and American companies manufacturing in country, not less. These things actually *fueled* China's rise.
Holy shit

My fav things about it: newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 1) Packaging - this might sound silly, but it comes with a plastic lid/cover that has a built-in slot for the mini spatula so you never have to use you fingers to scoop the product out (or lose small spatulas all the time if you're like me). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 2) The balm itself - I used this when my skin was an oil-slick pre-Accutane, and it continues to work great since starting Accutane. It has a light scent, but it's not unpleasant. Kinda herbal and sweet? It melts super quick and really takes off ALL your makeup/sunscreen. It was actually helping my skin heal/improve pre-Accutane. I switched back to Albolene for a week when I was traveling and started getting clogged pores on my forehead again. newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar 3) Probably the most relevant for you - with other cleansers like this, I've always had to wash my face after (like the 2 step Korean cleansing method). I don't even bother washing my face after this. I use a microfiber cloth to wipe it off and my face feels clean and very hydrated after. I've taken a cotton pad w/ witch hazel or micellar water after to check, and they swipe clean. It gets everything off w/out drying me out, breaking me out, or requiring a 2nd wash (I'm lazy and like to sleep as much as possible, ha). newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Aaand that's probably a much longer response than you wanted. =P newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: Also, I have really sensitive eyes and severe blepharitis (dry eyes). I haven't worn any eye makeup at all (no mascara, eye liner, eye shadows, etc. - literally nothing) in years save the very rare special occasion. Most cleansers irritate the skin near my eyes, but this one doesn't, and that's a huge plus for me.
This makes me very happy

His style is very unique but to me I love his mixing over his track selection.  When I saw him back in May it just felt like he knew how to play what he was playing, even if it didn't feel right.  He was a bit more on the mainstream side of psy, playing some Berg, a remix of The Calling, and even some psy remixes of non-electronic tracks, but the way he mixed it all together made it so damn fun and enjoyable.

4 of our next 5 games are against ranked opponents (assuming the seccg) but if you look at those teams (LSU, Miss State, Auburn, UGA) with the exception of Georgia, we’ll probably knock them all out of the rankings if/when we beat them if it isn’t close, destroying our SOS even more.

&gt; Couple's counseling doesn't treat BPD. It's not intense therapy, the therapist is assuming you want to work on things and everything spoken as fact.

Ex was arrested for domestic violence, but often tried to pin physical abuse on me; also verbally and emotionally abused me, coerced me into an open relationship, and belittled/mocked me every week.

I'm telling the truth, man. I'm not trying to lie to you that I'll pay for this stuff. I paid full price for the game (59.99) and the season pass and then full price for all of the season 2 DLC.

I'm the type of gamer that only likes a very small niche of games, so when something like BL2 comes around, I pre-order the game and season pass, then buy whatever other DLC is released.

I'm so sorry you experienced that.

Which says  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; King County pet licenses are required for all dogs and cats 8 weeks of age or older in most areas of the county. A pet license identifies and protects your dog or cat in case they get lost. Also, pet licenses offer other great benefits as well. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Even indoor-only cats or pets confined to fenced yards get loose and their licenses help assure you can be reunited with them. Licenses are inexpensive identification and are for your pet's protection and safety. License revenue also makes it possible to reunite lost pets with their families and for adoption services for homeless pets.  newlinechar  newlinechar Which is all bullshit. The chipping works similarly. newlinechar  newlinechar I realize it then goes on to say is required by law, but isn't the simple fact then that this is just another tax? newlinechar  newlinechar I don't have an issue with taxes but it just seems like a very round about way to do it. Its not that the license requires some kind of test it vetting like a gun or driving license. They could just as well institute a rake tax so anyone who owns a rake needs to buy a rake license...

Hey, who's that author you like who did the Ivory series again?
Cool, gl! You'll get there before I do. I've actually come to love it, the factory variant I mean. The five rounds force you to get really accurate. Today I had like 10 enemies charging across the snow at brusilov after they'd capd an obj and by hiding behind rocks and scrapping it out I was able to hold them all off at about 30-40m until my team caught up to me. Got four kills in under 30 seconds and had like 20hp by the time I got reinforced. Was pretty intense. I wish I'd had recording going. newlinechar  newlinechar At this point I'm just looking forward to a new gun to try out and a medic with an actual sniper scope sounds like a fun diversion. No idea if it'll be worth the effort but we'll find out soon. newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: I've had it a few days now and while it's fun, it is (should have known or at least googled) of course equipped with a 4x scope, as with the mondragon sniper. I was anticipating a 6-10x scope for some reason, which while obviously not an appropriate loadout for a medic who is supposed to be close to the action, would have been interesting. So I'm a little bit disappointed. 5 shots at long range would have been more useful than 5 at mid range.

To be clear, I'm saying that the definition of terrorism isn't that complicated. However, there are certainly cases where it's hard to establish whether or not an action was terrorism because intent is baked into the definition. Intent isn't always easy to pin down. In the case of the NYC attack, we have quite a bit of evidence already to pin down the motivations, so we can be confidant that this was in fact a terrorist attack. Here is a brief quote from a [nytimes article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/31/nyregion/police-shooting-lower-manhattan.html) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The rampage ended when the motorist — whom the police identified as Sayfullo Saipov, 29 — smashed into a school bus, jumped out of his truck and ran up and down the highway waving a pellet gun and paintball gun and shouting “Allahu akbar,” Arabic for “God is great,” before he was shot in the abdomen by the officer. He remained in critical condition on Tuesday evening. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Mayor Bill de Blasio declared the incident a terrorist attack and federal law enforcement authorities were leading the investigation. Investigators discovered handwritten notes in Arabic near the truck that indicated allegiance to ISIS, two law enforcement officials said. But investigators had not uncovered evidence of any direct or enabling ties between Mr. Saipov and ISIS and were treating the episode as a case of an “inspired” attacker, two counterterrorism officials said. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Mr. de Blasio said at a news conference, “Based on information we have at this moment, this was an act of terror, and a particularly cowardly act of terror aimed at innocent civilians.”

I agree.  Fox tends to support Trump.  They are the only network that has not declared open war on the man.  I'm sure there are differing opinions.  If these employees are THAT disgruntled, they SHOULD quit.  On the other hand, CNN HAS declared open war on Trump and isn't too fond of Fox, either.

You are not entitled to force anyone else to live by your personally chosen definition of the word 'person,' particularly in a free society where YOUR belief in fetal personhood is overwhelmingly [rejected (in both Colorado &amp; North Dakota)](https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/11/04/personhood-colorado_n_6104120.html), repeatedly, [when put to a vote (even in Mississippi)](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mississippis-personhood-amendment-fails-at-polls/) . So stop pretending your extremist definition of the word 'person' is widely accepted across our society, when it clearly is not &amp; never has been, not even once, when put to a vote.
