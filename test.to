Oladipo and Sabonis look great, the issue for them though is that Oladipo is still on a massive contract. They aren't getting his breakout on a rookie deal, so it's not a total steal. But overall much better than we first thought.

No, that is not the argument, we believe taxation is immoral, we don't care what happens after we remove taxation, whether it be the government crumbles or the people prosper(one in the same), the same went for abolitionists, they weren't making their arguments on practicality of cotton farming after the end of slavery, they were arguing for it on a moral basis, the same as us.

Dude they actually ARE nice. Idk if you’ve been around Mormons but they really are just nice people. And because you think like Stan and think that them having a worldview that doesn’t make any sense to you (rightfully so mind you it doesn’t make any sense to me) you relate to his anger. But why be angry? We can disagree in peace. I grew up non-Mormon in a Mormon area and had plenty of Mormon friends even though we disagreed. The fact that Stan would be rude about their beliefs, something that most people hold dear regardless of validity, on top of the fact that they aren’t hurting anyone makes Stan the immature and less understanding party.

I am ok with that, they defiantly needed a buff but I was afraid that they would just make the accusation more powerful 
Um.. I mean, I guess you're kind of weak early, so I would just try to survive the first like... 3 levels or so. I like to make sure I at least have two points in Q before I try to show any aggression in lane. If you miss your stun, don't commit to a fight unless you maybe have follow up cc from maybe like a nearby jungler or roaming solo laner.  newlinechar Even though it applies to any support champion in general, try to get deep vision for your jungler, ping where the enemy jungler is and be sure not to misuse your active items, as they're pretty important :D newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: quick follow up, my skill order on Taric is E &gt; W &gt; Q levels 1-3, then putting two more points into q at levels 4 and 5. I then like to max W first, then E, putting points into my ultimate whenever possible.

I've seen Guthrie mentioning it, however, I have to say I doubt he himself learned that way.

Agreed completely.  newlinechar  newlinechar Prime example is Aaron Francis, his footy would’ve developed s lot further with the aid of family support over the past couple of seasons. Whether that be at Port or the Crows.  newlinechar  newlinechar In Victoria each club gets a TAC Cup side, with the Murray bush rangers and Bendigo pioneers players having to go to the draft.  newlinechar  newlinechar Northern clubs have their academies, they can nominate one straight to senior list.  newlinechar  newlinechar Due to the difference in number of draftees, the dockers and eagle, and the crows and power split their local teams in half. 
Diego is obviously a former player that loves the club. I am talking about players that might not want to join now that we arent in the CL anymore and we arent winning the league any time soon either.

The GOTD picks are ranked according to my preference, whereby the highest listed pick is always my first preference, which would be equivalent to the POTD. Whereas further picks are only ranked descending in terms of kickoff time. The earlier a game starts, the higher it is listed.   newlinechar     - I don't select randomly a game of the day. I'm doing a lot of research and while these research, I go through various games. Some games, which are worth considering and promising, but haven't sufficient potential to be the game of the day, will be listed under the category further picks.   newlinechar     - I'm adhering to the game-of-the-day-approach with several picks, because it enables a higher degree of diversification and thus reduces the risk of loosing the entire invested stake. On top of this, after intensive research, it is mostly not that easy to select only one ultimate pick. Thus, the diversification eases slightly the pick selection process.  newlinechar  newlinechar     *Further Remarks* newlinechar     - No pick is a guaranteed win, so please only wager what you can afford to lose.   newlinechar     - Everything is possible in betting.    newlinechar     - Feedback is very welcome and appreciated.   newlinechar     - BOL everybuddy.

&gt;Because women have feminized/female brains. Men. As in cis men, have the exact opposite results. They develop gender dysphoria, depression, anxiety, etc. Same shit pre-transition trans people get. newlinechar  newlinechar Fucking no, Alice. Trans and GC keep telling you the studies on brain sex do not support your arguments. Brains are not sexed, and even if they were, it wouldn't matter because that's not how we reproduce. No one sees my brain to see how to interact with me. My brain is not preprogramed for feminine behavior, and it's fucking sexist to   repeatedly do this. Just because *you* are a feminine person does not mean that female people are inherently feminine. The fact that you were born with a penis and are a feminine person disproves your very theory. How do you not get this?  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;I notice everyone. That's what I do when I'm out. I look at people. Just fascinating to me.

Yes, I’m just saying it’s particularly high on Jarvis map I have found.   newlinechar  newlinechar The thing is, if you look - when it’s happening it’s almost always at the same time that Ping is going insane.   newlinechar  newlinechar There is an underlying problem with the game code.  It’s not peoples connections, these spikes happen all the time no matter how good the connection is.  There is also still a memory leak problem - it seems progressive based on how many games you have played since the last full reboot of the game.  I’ve been having huge problems, closed out the game, totally restarted it - and the same people playing with the same connections runs smooth as silk again.  
Pretty sure UGA had homefield advantage that game, though.

Look at his rankings. They are always different from the other 31, there are always gripes with him every week. He always pulls a random stat to put a team above or below others. Cards at 32 behind Browns and 49ers is a joke. Colts behind the Browns and 49ers when they (the Colts) beat both those teams. Seems like a grudge against the team. Pats are top 3 from everyone else and he's got em at 10. When he has the Bills and Texans above them.

I know. I think them losing another game before Michigan and losing to Michigan helps Wisconsin more than them losing to Michigan only (or even beating Michigan) before the title game. That way Wisconsin can say they beat a 1 loss PSU and probably ranked Michigan team versus just beating a 1 loss OSU.

Yeah but the gross underestimation about how many white people are in South Africa is ridiculous. When you see pictures of South Africa they usually only show the native tribes or a majority of black people. I don’t think I’ve ever seen a picture that a professional has taken that has white people unless it was for die antwoord. South Africa was colonized by the English, Dutch, Germans, Indians, and Portuguese. There are many other races there besides black now

If you ask ten people you'll get ten different answers. newlinechar  newlinechar In my opinion it's a mixture of not getting sufficient experience early on in school when you are making these decisions, need for more patient interaction, fear of encroachment (which by the way is massively overblown) and ego. newlinechar  newlinechar By ego I mean a lot of the time you are not acknowledged for your efforts and if you do your job right, it's like you never existed at all.

Talk to any current provider and they will tell you that it won't happen in 30 years.

No that’s not what I’m saying. newlinechar  newlinechar What I’m saying is, yes, George Washington might feel differently today about slavery (or not, who knows?). Same for O’Sensei.

He's not going to sign for the min in free agency, he'll get a better offer close to the salary he was scheduled to amek. He makes under $5 million right now and any trade would have likely involved a salary filler.  newlinechar  newlinechar And of course they weren't going to get assets for a a player they didn't value. But it's not like they were going to have to attach compensation for someone to take him. 100% there were offers for an expiring, B/C level prospects or a 2nd round pick. If you really have 0 value for a guy like Okafor then you take that deal and move on.

Well, it all depends on the reaction you want if you ever get in the situation of being attacked or threatened. Most dogs do not ever go beyond barking (which is good in general). It takes years of training and very strict obedience to get a specific reaction from a dog. A well trained dog will know the difference between a man coming up and making small talk and the same man starting to say threatening words. The protection dog will also go beyond the bark threshold and will bite/attack a person if they show very aggressive behavior and note, not when you tell the dog to bite. Lastly and even more importantly, a well trained dog can be recalled from an attack at any second.  newlinechar So, yes, big goals to train a real protection dog.  newlinechar  newlinechar If you only want a bigger dog that may scare off some strangers and may bark threatening then I think it's important to look at the puppy's demeanor. You will want to pick a bold puppy. newlinechar  newlinechar Even my small border collie mix will protect me if a stranger would come at me. He probably wouldn't bite but at least bark and make a big fuss.

I'm imagining very early detection and very thorough interventions. Since this is an ideal scenario, assume perfect detection of potential dysphoria (or, perfect assessment of what gender a person will eventually identify as). Apply a perfect transition procedure, and there are no more trans people. Everyone just gets to be the sex/gender they want to be. newlinechar  newlinechar I say there are no more trans people, because an early and thorough enough transition will give a person a fully male/female experience. They won't belong to a third switchy category - they'll just be male or female, essentially from birth.  newlinechar  newlinechar Edit: either that, or highly effective treatment for dysphoria that doesn't involve transitioning.

Unfortunately, I think it would be, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but I was diagnosed at 19 with no head injury. If you don't notice any progression into actual seizures or the problem goes away, than you may not have to worry, but it wouldn't hurt to talk to a doctor, and consider abstaining from alcohol if you are not, marijuana may be helpful. An eeg might reveal whether you have any abnormal brain activity. My seizures often happen at night and I don't have any memory of them so it's difficult to self diagnose, but these auras could actually be minor siezures themselves. If you suffer from anxiety, panic symptoms can mimic auras so you may be in luck. I wish you the best, it can be treated with the right medications

&gt; Name one church father who believed in purgatory. newlinechar  newlinechar Read G. Nyssa, *Dialogus de Anima et Resurrectione*. Therein, Macrina describes a purgatorial state in which the soul is painfully freed from lesser loves.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Charismatics don't, also hermeneutic is a way of interpreting the bible. Just because people claim its your highest authority doesn't mean 2 people can't have different ways of interpreting it. newlinechar  newlinechar Really? I've met lots of charismatics who would also sign on to *sola Scriptura*. And of course *sola Scriptura* doesn't preclude a multitude of interpretations - that's the point. The same method gives rise to mutually exclusive interpretations.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;The bible. He was preaching a false Christ. 2 Corinthians 11:4 newlinechar  newlinechar Arius was reading the Bible. The Church as the authoritative interpreter was the one who condemned Arius. The same Church condemned Luther's errors.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Since all the people who were at the council of Nicaea were dead by the time Luther showed up, I'm going with no. newlinechar  newlinechar So you think the Church has no continuity? Weird.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;Except Luther was right while Arius was wrong. newlinechar  newlinechar You've given no reason why. Nicaea yes and Trent no is just incoherent. Give me a reason to trust Nicaea and not Trent that isn't rooted in your personal preferences.

I surprised a deputy because I won Fox Labs, Sabre Reds, Sabre 5.0, Sabre Defense, and Defense Technology sprays. I have some other sprays that can't be ordered, but that's because of a friend.  He didn't even know civilians could order that stuff. People like getting that shit at gas stations and checkout lines, but I never do. If I'm getting OC, I want it to work. My smallest OC spray is half an oz, but it was only $3 and it's Sabre. Just about everything else is MK3 or MK4. Our sporting good stores often have Sabre Red Gels in the MK3s though, but people think they're too big. newlinechar  newlinechar Ohio University PD uses the weakest spray still made- .2% Defense Technology. I carry fucking .67% and I'm not relying on it to regularly stop violent people. Weakest OC that should be carried is .4%.

Bez przesady, obraza uczuć religijnych to moim zdaniem sensowny przepis, który pozwala trzymać poziom debaty publicznej. Nie jest to żaden przejaw braku rozdziału państwa od kościoła bo po 1) jest bardzo wstrzemięźliwie stosowany 2) istnieje także w krajach które wcale nie są jakoś bardzo uzależnione od kościoła (Niemcy np.) 3) dotyczy obrazy każdych uczuć religijnych, nie tylko katolickich. Nie jest też prawdą że musiałaby wykazać konkretną szkodę, bo w systemie prawa kontynentalnego mogłaby żądać zadośćuczynienia za doznaną krzywdę (przeżycia psychiczne), która jest niemierzalna w pieniądzu.

I highly doubt Christianity damaged Rome, nor is it lunar. What is lunar is the mechanicity of sin, which Rome was dragged down into (moral decadence). The Catholic church was also a dogmatic perversion of Christianity, the monk and nunnery was designed to prepare young people with proper values before they would get married. This was distorted based on misunderstood writings within the bible (e.g. regarding Paul). newlinechar  newlinechar Any religion can be understood as being solar if only you know how to read it. For example Islam can actually be interpreted usefully. The unbelievers are inside of us, the bestial and instinctive elements inside of us for example. But that religion was also corrupted by evil people, particularly as of recent with the CIA dumping tons of money into radicalizing Sunnis. newlinechar  newlinechar If you want to paint everything black or white with a very broad brush then go ahead, in the adult world we understand that it takes one or two sentences to comprehend what is actually happening, because what is legitimately good is often corrupted, and you know where it always leads? To atheism and communism. You need to take and use things that already exist or combine them, you can't invent a new religion.

I played him as well in one league last week. Mostly for lack of a better option. I think it was fairly reasonable to be skeptical of Fuller going against that Seattle D.

There is nothing to disagree with here. If you play Williams theme 99% of the world population will immediately know that this is that theme. That theme has been featured countless of times in popular media, Movies, tv shows, commercials etc. It has been sampled and has been interpolated.

All conjecture, really.  A lot of people also turned on Hillary after the DNC emails surfaced, showing that the left seems to be less likely to follow corrupt people as the right.

Since I love co-op, I started specializing in PvE low-level builds immediately after my first run of Dark Souls. I've gone through both games multiple times at levels around 10, 20 and 50, and in DS1 I never touch vitality (whereas I put extra points in Bloodborne if I can, due to the massive damage-vit imbalance.) newlinechar  newlinechar For Souls games, it is true in general; while offensive stats go a long way, they only make a difference if planned wisely, and even then - due to soft caps - not many levels are needed.  newlinechar  newlinechar In Bloodborne, where weapons are absurdly enhanced by gems besides natural upgrading and scaling, BL can become irrelevant for an expert player, as long as they farm the right gems. It only starts to make a serious difference in depth 5 chalices, which the vast majority of players enter around level 120 anyway; and even there, figuring out the moveset of a boss leads to fairly easy no-hit fights where even Vit becomes irrelevant. I've opened and completed several FRC chalices of my own at level 4. newlinechar  newlinechar This, of course, doesn't mean leveling does not matter; it makes everything a lot more relaxed, it crushes bosses, and it is by far the wisest choice for players who enjoy spending multiple game cycles on the same build or running FRC chalices for exploration and fun. However, it is equally true that practice and blood gems combined can nullify the need for more BLs. 
Yes it is. There are heaps of UN camps around asylum hot spots

They aren't terribly squishy. They have low HP, of course, but excellent damage mitigation techniques. They work particularly well with Haste, which boosts their already top-notch AC, the ever-important Dexterity saves, and their offensive ability all in one go.

The UK drastically deflates their statistics for homicides because the Home Office only counts and reports murders based on the outcome of the investigation and trial, not on the number of violent crimes that result in death. newlinechar  newlinechar If you look at coroner's inquests with percentage of deaths in relation to the number violent crimes, and then compare that to the murder rate in the states, the numbers are pretty similar.

I'm having a bit of a hard time figuring out how to do it. With the stun reduction in general from the Strength change, and the change on the stun from 4.25s to 3s, the stun is weaker for sure. The knockback is its only saving grave. And now that the adaptive strikes are separated, I'll never be using the agility part, and therefore I won't be dealing the 100dmg base. newlinechar  newlinechar Then comes the part that if morphling's Morph dies, so does he. The fact that Hybrid was expendable was a good portion of it. Now you need to be really careful when it comes to turning into which hero. Since Morph copies the target's base stats, turning into a squishy support will make you equally as squishy, regardless of how much strength you have morphed. newlinechar  newlinechar Then comes the fact that being able to use Morph on allies only comes at lvl 20, and what's when current morphling's playstyle mirrors that of previous morphling's aghs playstyle. That means morphling can't really be run as a support easily, he needs too much experience, and what he can do at early levels is very limited. newlinechar  newlinechar However, on the offlane, with the new changes to the lane and to where the creeps meet (plus the more ruthless deny change) it's incredibly hard to even gain any experience in the offlane. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm having a hard time seeing where morphling goes. At all.
You’re right. There’s definitely no blame to be laid at the feet of the mob who slashed investment in renewable energy or who continue to promote coal as the one true source of energy. Its definitely not the fault of those who removed taxes that would encourage those behaviours to be reduced. It’s all because of the people using the power instead of the people who generate it.

Well most writers write to be published - or have aspirations of publishing anyway. newlinechar  newlinechar And the reality of the publishing industry is that you'll probably be writing for many, many years before you'll see enough money to quit your day job (or it may never happen). That's why most of us write outside of work hours - which requires sacrificing our personal time. newlinechar  newlinechar If you're not writing for publication though, then quite frankly, you can do whatever you want. newlinechar  newlinechar If getting read and selling books isn't a concern and you're just writing to get a story out of your head, well then sure, skip the reading. The reading is how you learn to write stories that readers will pay for. newlinechar  newlinechar

I think the issue is that some people take it to an extent where their requests for trigger warnings start impeding on other peoples’ rights to express themselves.

As I said, you get a credit that of what you paid that applies towards the tax you owe. newlinechar  newlinechar If you bought a car in CA and paid $5000 sales tax on it, and WA says the sales tax in WA on that car would have been $5100, you owe WA $100. If the tax in CA was $5000 and WA says it would have been $4900, you owe WA nothing. You're only making up the difference, as if you'd bought it in WA. newlinechar  newlinechar And of course, either case only applies if you bought the car in the last 90 days.

Well, New Zealand doesn't have laws for nominee holding, so you would need to do it via a trust. You would also need to specifically take action to hide this fact from the AML reporting entity you work with during the purchase, and also from the body who will be charged with ensuring compliance with the OIA. You also probably couldn't use a corporate or professional shareholding from a lawyer, as any half-arsed KYC search should uncover that.  newlinechar  newlinechar So to do what you are describing in practice in New Zealand in the near-future, you would need to find a person who is not known to be a corporate director, a professional director, trustee, trustee shareholder, nominee shareholder, or nominee director. You would also need them to collude with you to specifically not disclose your position as the UBO of the setup. So you are right in that it can be done...but it is probably illegal, and will probably lock you away from your rental or sale income.
I think that's fair, but I also think Jimmy is a better QB that would have been acquired for less than McCarron and that would have been the real poopy pants. newlinechar  newlinechar Because realistically, I'm sure Hue knows and likes McCarron as a QB, but if they paid that for him and threw him in only to have him suck, Hue might not be out of there anyway.

What I meant by unit balance was that each individual character is an effective choice. Axes and Lances are more valuable just on merit of there being so few, but you arent screwing yourself by using Lianna instead of Corrin or vice versa for example.

What's sad is people believing trump when he has a track record of lying and being dishonest. T_D routinely puts out false information to fit their narrative. 
I'm pretty sure he was being facetious, Mortal Kombat very famously led to very public trials and the creation of the ESRB and it was when the 'mainstream' started to notice not all games were being developed with kids in mind as their main demographic.
Is that a Mizzou guitar??

Fair enough. And with their heightened abilities, they'd probably be able to dodge majority of Stand abilities. Once again, my imagination isn't good enough to come up with how the fight would go down, but I would assume that there would be more casualties. I can't imagine a smarter vampire like Dio and the Pillarmen not take Stand abilities into account when facing any humans, for that matter. Especially since you can't really tell who has a Stand ability or not. It evens out the playing field between humans and vampires quite a bit.

In my Dietetics learning I've found that despite people thinking they're unique in that their body is able to adjust their metabolism so much that they simply can't gain weight. If you're consuming 3500 kcal above TEE (total energy expenditure) you simply can't.  I repeat CANT not gain weight. Impossible. Physical activity is the most variable source of energy expenditure and can require 10,000 kcal or more in cases of Michael Phelps or other extreme athletes. True. However, they actually need the extra energy to supply their extra activity. Your body has the ability to simulate metabolism by increasing fidgeting or by causing you to have a restless leg.  But if you eat enough and as your stomach expands and you release more ghrelin and neuropeptide Y you can't avoid losing weight.  I'm sorry to take such a strong opposing opinion to yours but physics just doesn't allow for your idea to be true... Your hormones may be able to move energy storage or direct energy storage into more or less dense storage forms such as by increasing lipogenesis or glycogenesis but energy is never created or destroyed. 
You should be able to throw a putter flat and it will fly pretty far and it should stay mostly flat without flipping over and burning into the ground.

Yeah I mean it’ll all be sorted out in the remaining games. The problem is what happens if OSU and Clemson and Oklahoma all win out?

At this point it becomes harder to say. Some games we were lucky not to concede or at times we only managed to score by set piece or individual brilliance.

It was the community that left Wikia; it wasn't like there was a split in userbase and people just stuck around with an objectively inferior wiki that tried to control you for financial gain. You would have to either be part of Wikia, complicit with them, or purely ignorant of the history while also just being okay with a worse site (which is the likely scenario) that is no longer even advertised or easier to access. Meanwhile if you actually choose to cripple your source of information because of the interface you have a different problem.

Well that's a strange jump. I mean they did own people, hunted them if they tried to escape killed them and broke up families , beat them, raped them, and sold them for a profit and went to war against their country to keep doing that, then spent 100 years trying to keep them from having basic human rights let alone the civil rights enshrined to them by birth in our laws but do you really want to call them evil? I mean animals? Sure they burned castrated and hanged men for false accusations or wearing a uniform they were issued coming home from war they fought in while having no rights at home, destroyed property and did everything humanly possible to deny people their humanity, but why the harsh language?

Correct, but I'd argue for most people (and certainly someone in OP's position) that threshold is never crossed assuming we're speaking in a purely monetary sense. Even if you're paid $50-100 an hour to work during your normal 9 to 5 your opportunity cost is not nearly as high during off hours, unless you have the option to and take advantage of working longer hours.
No, because all Clemson truly has is a squeaked out win versus a mediocre Auburn team, and a win against VT.

tbf, you have to have a very high IQ to understand the Kings. The playmaking is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of post moves most of the highlights will go over a typical viewer’s head. There’s also the fans' nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their characterisation- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Dragon Ball Z literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of the team, to realise that they’re not just ball players- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike the Kings truly ARE idiots.

Tbh they've both had some success outside the 10 position. Under Ancelotti at Madrid he rarely played with a 10 and James excelled that year. So its not like they are both confined to the 10.

No, someone was asking about a dog that may offer protection and you were right there recommending your poorly bred designer mutt. There is no guarantee that your dog magically only inherited the good qualities of either breed it is mixed from, that is the kind of genetic lottery that is not set up in anyone’s favor. Malamutes and GSDs were bred for very different purposes and very different temperaments and just because they both are fuzzy and have prick ears does not mean the cross is one that should be bred.

Of course people do and should have the right to choose themselves. And for me, my decision is based on the rejection of socially constructed fear mongering. I like what KS does in his movies and my opinion about him as an actor won't change even if I come to understand that the was a gay child assaulter with a frighteningly sad childhood all alonh. I don't care about him as a person, why would I, I don't know him. Therefore hypothetically if I were an actor, I would see no reason to not work with him. If I were among his inner circle on the other hand, that would be an entirely different thing. But I'm not, so I won't act as if.

Did you read the article?

No, just some.

Yeah, no, I've seen the other comments about this boner reduction technique, I just don't get the logic that this need to make the boner go away justifies touching somebody else's genitals without their consent.

Yeah I definitely think someone will take a chance on him. I think the big question is about that last part, because right now he just isn't much use to most teams. He doesn't do much other than score and he doesn't even do that particularly efficiently. He really needs to add something else to his game to be valuable. If he can develop an outside shot or work enough to be not a complete disaster on defense  he could be a valuable piece for many teams. But it has been three years now and it isn't like he hasn't had opportunities on Philly to develop. I mean it isn't like Philly has been a great team in his time there, he hasn't exactly been stuck behind some amazing players and never had an opportunity to play significant minutes. He is now into his third season and Philly doesn't even trust him to be in the rotation when they have every incentive to want to showcase him for a trade. newlinechar  newlinechar He isn't a lost cause or anything, but he might be one more bad year from being considered one.

Generally losing fat or gaining muscle are the big ones. Nutrition has little to do with either of these, although eating right is definitely a good step. Losing or gaining weight is a function of caloric intake. If you eat more than your body requires in a given day to move and survive, it will store the extra as fat or muscle. If you eat less, you'll lose fat or muscle. If you're working out and eating enough protein your body will favor putting on muscle and taking off fat.

Keep in mind the bronze dragon isn't holding the townsfolk hostage. Either the dragon isn't aware of the charade around her (and isn't aware some townsfolk know of her true nature) and doesn't realise the effect her gold-for-gossip has on the town (she's a young dragon after all), or she does know but is enjoying the entertainment nonetheless (like a person might enjoy their daily soap opera, despite knowing it's not real), not realising that it's stopped being fun for the townspeople. This is obviously up to the DM to decide. Either way however, the dragon isn't forcing anyone to participate - she's just rewarding those who do (either knowingly or unknowingly). She's not evil, and doesn't bear any ill will to the people of the town. newlinechar  newlinechar The players could/should certainly go to the dragon and explain the situation. The dragon's reaction is again up to the DM, but as a bronze dragon I think she'd most likely find it a funny story rather than that she would react in anger. The townspeople's fear of her comes from their lack of knowledge of dragons combined with the fact that many of them know they've been 'exploiting' this dragon/woman's interest in gossip for their own benefit. And it is that fear that now keeps them trapped inside a web of lies of their own making.

You have to use a compositor (like compton) that will allow you to use transparency effects. Then, in your .Xresources file, use hex transparency code (i.e., #AARRGGBB instead of #RRGGBB) to set the transparency in your rofi configuration. For my setup, I used 60% transparency (#99) for the main background, then full opacity for the line element backgrounds with a line margin of 0 and a large padding; this makes it look like there's an opaque menu on top of a transparent background.
You mean to switch accounts there?

I don't know how they screwed up Hunter so march. What I'd really like them to do is make something that plays like Bard in FFXIV, which is probably the most fun I've ever had in an MMO.

Yeah, it sucks a lot. When it comes to buying clothing, the two fits that really matter are the length of the crotch and the breadth of the shoulders. Everything else is a fairly straight forward fix, but those two require massive deconstruction in which we have to essentially remake the pants. Imo, it's easier to make a pair of pants from scratch than to have to shorten the length of the crotch. When it's too long, you have to take them apart at the seams and resew it all-- often removing any pockets as well because they won't hang correctly a lot of the time. A hem takes 15 minutes. Shortening the gusset can take half a day, easily.

Monroe is a very good passer ill grant you, but Jefferson was known a black hole in Utah who improved enough to be more effective later in his career and Kanter isn't a great passer either, but he was usually put on okc 2nd teams with no better option than him trying to finish on a double team. I would argue on the right team, with the right coach Jah could develop into as good or better of a passer as Al or Kanter. Only way we'll find out is if a good team takes a flyer on him next season.

&gt; It's self-evident in either case. If I follow female 'gender roles' for a day, does that make me a woman for a day. Of course not.  newlinechar  newlinechar You keep saying things like 'self evident' and now 'of course not', but if we concede that gender is a social construct that's completely separate from biological sex, and you felt and acted like a woman for 1 day, then yes, you're a woman for that one day. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; What you actually believe is that someone's gender is determined by what he believes about his own gender. If he says he's a woman, he's a woman. If he changes his mind tomorrow, then he's not. It has nothing to do with 'gender roles'. newlinechar  newlinechar Yes, that's correct. People are free to change their mind about their gender based on how they feel and identify accordingly newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; aren't you the same people who oppose gender stereotyping and would vociferously object if someone were called less of a woman because she didn't follow the proper gender roles? newlinechar  newlinechar This is a pretty common point to raise--the seeming contradiction between transgender expression and the desire to eliminate set-in-stone gender roles. I'm not a trans person myself so I don't have personal insight into this, but if you google 'reconciling transgender with gender roles' (no quotes) you can find a lot of honest responses to this (I know you hate the site everydayfeminism, which turns out to be the first link, but skip it and you'll find plenty more if you actually care to read about it) newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Of course I don't, especially as it is used today. There are gender roles (and they're good, by the way), proper ways to act for men and women. newlinechar  newlinechar Well I obviously disagree with the former, and your use of the phrase 'proper ways to act'. I doubt I will convince you otherwise here. But, if gender and sex are the same, then exactly how do you explain the fact that transgender people exist in such non-trivial numbers? Why do so many people just *know* that they're born into the wrong body? The *only* other explanation is that they're all faking it, but that's highly unlikely, because being trans can be a horrible experience almost universally linked with shame, death threats, rejection from your family, friends etc., and these negative aspects can and often do end in murder or suicide. newlinechar  newlinechar And, if you're still reading to the end, I'd kindly ask you to take the last sentence to heart. Even if you don't agree with the arguments, or if you think trans people are all deluded or crazy or whatever, it's a statistical fact that many of them are the targets of never-ending torrents of hatred. You could do your part and stop making fun of them at every opportunity. newlinechar  newlinechar 
Interesting, and yeah Berkeley does seem to be hyper-liberal. Who konws, maybe my experience is skewed by my own perspective? Being an independent who tends to be more liberal, I was surrounded by like-minded individuals but it still seemed like people did a good job of not group thinking everything to death. This coming from my time at George Mason which at the time had a breakdown of roughly 70-80% of students were liberal-leaning (self-reporting study which is known to have issues, though it seemed fairly accurate based on experience).

Seeing as crossmr has edited his long string of accusations, I shall edit mine too.

I walk away from this thread exonerated and with no stain on my character. But there were many happy to believe the accusations against me; to upvote my accuser and downvote my defence. I hope that they will think long and hard about what they have done and take a look at themselves and their actions. Justice may have prevailed in this case, but others might not be so lucky. In fact, I've a good mind to ask Korea Exposé to write a story on the case, to highlight the plight of others unfairly accused of writing for them. I ask now for some privacy so that I can rebuild my life. Thank you.

The problem is that people that don't get sick think it is a handicap, and it is beyond them to have to play with teleportation rather than thinking of it as simply another gameplay mechanic. I think of it as a separate game type in the same way I think that a platform game is different than a racing game which is different than a first person shooter which all have different core gameplay mechanics. There are instances where a game tries to throw in teleportation or free movement as an afterthought and that is where the problems is lie.

I'm not saying it should be skill intensive, but the game shouldn't play itself. Take viktor, a simple but effective character that's not as difficult to play as bk or drogoz. That's perfect because it's friendly to new players but still can be learnt so that you'll be really effective at higher levels without requiring this kind of cheap abilities.

I am also a convert and a US citizen. Been Muslim for nearly 7 years.  newlinechar  newlinechar In the case of the 2nd generation ones, I am noticing that a lot of men are begin whine and moan about how Islam in the US is relaxing and getting more liberal, along with griping about the increasing visibility and power of women in the community (In regards to women, look up Wallah Bro). The constant refrain on how Islam is totally conservative. Which is funny because I can shoot that down historically.  newlinechar  newlinechar In regards to converts, I notice that a lot if them convert for the rules, not the values, if that makes sense. They follow the sharia, usually the most hardline they can, but without the values of mercy, compassion, kindness, among others.  newlinechar  newlinechar I find these two groups to be susceptible to radicalisation. There is already one guy I am watching who fits in the second group. newlinechar  newlinechar However, I was wrong on my guess today.

Ah, so if you're undefeated you automatically deserve a high ranking. That makes sense. Then TCU should just go join the MAC and make the playoff every year. newlinechar  newlinechar Wisconsin's schedule last year was solid, but hardly a gauntlet. When it came down to it, they played two top 15 teams in the regular season: Michigan and Ohio State. What was Wisconsin's big marquee win last year? LSU, who finished at #20? Compare to, say, Ohio State, who played Oklahoma, Wisconsin, Penn State and Michigan—all top 10 teams, three of whom they beat. newlinechar  newlinechar Even so, Wisconsin was the top ranked 3-loss team in the final CFP rankings. The defense that you so badly wanted was one that they literally got. newlinechar  newlinechar And now that they have an easy year, I will indeed point out that they play no one, because they play no one. newlinechar  newlinechar P.S.

The way I see it is that trigger warnings acyually allow for more self expression.

It'll give them a firm grasp on the mainland and allow them to finally become a bigger player on the world stage, especially after getting their teeth kicked in with the failed invasion of North America. Perhaps I'm overestimating the AI too much here, but maybe they learned that naval invasions aren't the best and now wants to take a land route. It'll be even more invasion if Korea backs them up in the war, plus with an easy target like Mongolia still available, they may be able to establish a permanent presence.

Toddler is very well taken care of, my husband and I switch off class days so he doesn't do daycare- he always has mommy or daddy. No yelling or anything around him, or really in our house. Only good thing is that my stuff seems to be so internalized and private that my toddler doesn't notice (I think partly because we always had seperate mealtimes anyway, since I always cook full balanced meals for him it always worked better for him to eat a later breakfast than us, but earlier lunch and dinner. My husband has already gone to basic, it's required for national guard here and cannot go active duty until his national guard deployment orders are over (he goes to Afghanistan in january) I just don't feel I have the ability to put off schooling, since schooling itself will take quite a few years.

You need to finish one campaign before you start the next.  newlinechar  newlinechar By the time you get to the StugIV and finished the campaign, you should already have five crew.  newlinechar  newlinechar Retraining the crew is another story. You need to have that tank unlocked already before you can train onto that vehicle. If it's a premium vehicle. You do not need to retrain the crew. The crew just needs to be competent in the same class of vehicle.  newlinechar  newlinechar For example. You have a Comet crew. You can put them in the special Cromwell Berlin without retraining them.  newlinechar  newlinechar Cromwell B = British + Medium Tank newlinechar  newlinechar Comet = British + Medium Tank. 
No. It's not. What you're talking about is enabling and it helps NO ONE. These girls would fare a LOT better if they took an OUNCE of ownership over their shitty decisions. But you go ahead and keep doing what you're doing - I'm sure you and they will never have a problem finding someone to blame rather than actually DOING something. 
That -18 turns into a +20 as soon as the rebellion starts though. If you let them sit for just 3 turns it will bring it back up to about -40. Depending on your garrison they will usually sit there for 3-5 turns building forces. newlinechar  newlinechar So by the time you are done taking over the next region and/or province you can turn back around and deal with the rebellion. By the time you are done with that your PO will be a lot higher (probably somewhere between -40 and 0) and your corruption should be higher as well, which means the PO penalty will be more manageable.

I'm putting all remaining eggs in this basket, because I'm getting way too many replies for what was intended as a one-off expression of exhaustion with the handful of individuals are *relentless* with this stuff. OP made another post on the exact same subject *just yesterday.* Today, they didn't even bother with a tenuous level of context. I am **not** against this post kind of in general. *I just didn't want to see yet another tomorrow.* newlinechar  newlinechar I agree with most of that. The one thing I would contend is that I believe we should do more to play devil's advocate against that domination, because there is a critical point where it will drive the last of them to /r/JordanPeterson (and, holy crap, they were at 5k subs a few months ago and now they're bigger than this sub) and the diverse viewpoints will no longer be here.
&gt;You don't have to do nanowrimo if you don't want to. Not everyone has any desire to write a book, and that's okay. newlinechar  newlinechar I know. I just wanted to at least give it a try.

I figured since everyone else doing it right now that I might try to participate at least a little bit. newlinechar  newlinechar Edgar Rice Burroughs got his start because he thought the stories in pulp publication were terrible and that he could do better.

Some them are so incompetently plotted and badly written, that is baffling that the source text they were adapted from was published at all. 
They didn't make fun of it being a disease, they made fun of how people use the disease as an excuse. Having a disease doesn't mean you are powerless and must succumb to it, or look to a higher power to cure it, or that every shitty thing you do is because of it.  newlinechar  newlinechar The point of the episode was that people have somehow become convinced that they are powerless to overcome their disease and that only a higher power could possibly cure them (Twelve steps BS). That is horseshit and SP called them out on it. Alcoholism is a hard disease to deal with, but it is in no way impossible to manage.

To be fair, the Clintons have been known to be quite shady on more than one occasion. Running a private email server for government correspondence(neatly circumventing disclosure), and the way the HRC campaign operated with the DNC against Bernie, for example.

&gt;  Muslims to follow DURING A HOLY WAR. newlinechar  newlinechar This is the distinction! When does a holy war start? When cartoonists depict Muhammad?  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;5:53, “… whoso kills a soul, unless it be for murder or for wreaking corruption in the land, it shall be as if he had killed all mankind; and he who saves a life, it shall be as if he had given life to all mankind.” newlinechar 2:256, “There is no compulsion in religion. The right way has become distinct from error.” newlinechar  newlinechar These are Meccan verses, I believe most schools of Islam defer to the later more violent Medina verses after their expulsion because they were written later. ~~It is called naskah?~~  Naishk https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naskh_(tafsir)  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;So your quote of the “forceful spreading of Islam” is a complete lie. newlinechar  newlinechar Look at history please. At the least it isn't a lie. Abbasid (conquered Middle East), Umayyad (North Africa Spain, and southern France), Seljuq (Anatolia), Ottoman (Byzantines :(, Balkans, Greece) caliphates gave Rome a run for their money  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;You call the the prophet a “warlord” when you’re ignoring that to be an aggressor is a sin. As seen in the quote below. newlinechar  newlinechar First of all Muhammed was unequivocally a warlord. But the point of aggression is the next vital component.What can be classified as aggression? Because Meccans certainly prosecuted Muslims, the whole point of my post was to show how you could twist and equate this with the modern west oppressing or slandering the Islamic faith newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;It’s insane to see this much hate inside someone that it would cause them to post lies in hopes that someone would believe them newlinechar  newlinechar Save it.  newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;If you seriously want to know more, check the context of the quotes that you posted, as well as mine. newlinechar  newlinechar I've read much of the Quran and Sirat.

I should specify that I am primarily a nonfiction writer, though the answer to your question is pretty much the same for fiction or nonfiction. newlinechar  newlinechar You conquer it like you conquer anything else standing in between you and the paycheck you need to live: you just get up and fucking do it. The choice between not writing and not eating is a pretty easy one and it overcomes a lot of resistance. newlinechar  newlinechar edited to add - i should also note that I've got at least as many half-written garbage stories on my hard drive as anyone else who's ever tried to write anything, including some execrable stuff from a phase in high school when I was convinced that it was my destiny to write Star Trek novels for Pocket Books. I tend to be a hell of a lot less productive when my mortgage isn't riding on my writing. newlinechar  newlinechar So maybe that's the trick to conquering lack of motivation: put yourself into a position where the writing is your formal day job and sole source of income :D

Mutualism is where individuals or collectives possess the means of production and goods and services are traded according to the amount of labour that went into their production.

I'd argue that even if that was true (I'll go into why it's not), that would still be a valid argument for it having value. Not being controlled by a state is very valuable for people in third world, tyrannical countries. And there will always be black markets.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar Why is it still valuable? Because a bitcoin is a token that gives you space in the largest blockchain. Since that space can be programmed and designed for different financial sintruments or assets (even ones in the physical world), bitcoin will be valuable as long as the blockchain it is on is the chain that best fulfills the potential of the technology. Venmo is still expensive and inefficient on the back end. If I were Venmo I'd prefer a transaction that takes 15 seconds for clearing and settlement (stats for Ethereum) over the complicated mess that is the inter-bank payment system.  newlinechar  newlinechar  newlinechar But more importantly, you can spend Bitcoin directly at Steam, Overtsock.com, Newegg, Microsoft, and anywhere with bitcoin debit card like Xapo.

US soldier versus private mercenary would be a good comparison but not strictly relevant to this discussion. Private school teacher vs public school teacher would be another interesting one. I went to private Catholic schools as a kid, and teachers admitted that they got paid less, but they also had to put up with way less shit from kids than they had to a public school. That doesn't work across the board though, because there are definitely private schools that pay teachers more than public schools.  newlinechar  newlinechar The question also needs to be asked about whether, if public workers are paid more, if public workers are fundamentally overpaid, or if private workers are underpaid.

i know it does, and you're insinuating that the game itself shouldn't include certain elements as people are slightly more sensitive to them at the point of release. if that's not what you're saying then don't even bother to listening to me because i've clearly misunderstood, but there's a few issues with that. that's censorship, which in art is first of all bad, because art's self expression. that's also censoring things down to what's perceived as offensive during certain times, which is irrelevant, because art lives on, and in 5 or 10 years when certain issues have been resolved or looked over, that game will still be affected by the censorship people forced into it. it's a fictional creation about people that don't exist in a world that doesn't exist, during a time period that doesn't even relate to our own. the world of the game is different to ours, and isn't actually happening, so to put real-world issues into a fictional creation is beyond stupid. it's fake, it's not real, and people are wanting to hold naughty dog back and tell them what not to write and create in their games, when it's the freedom they had that allowed them to create such good games in the first place. newlinechar  newlinechar it's a woman abducted by a fanatic cult, pinned down by two men in a forest, has her arm shattered by a hammer, where both men are then executed by a woman with a bow and arrow, then the attacker is strangled then killed by the hammer, ending with the three survivors overrun by parasitic zombies. these events do not relate to anything in the real world, at least right now, and not to the extent of it being a prevailing issue. religious fanatic cults are not gutting and hanging people in america, zombies don't exist, and women don't maintain triceps like that on a post-apocalyptic diet.

Yeah, one of the longest and most common complaints is that WWE likes to make their cruiserweights wrestle like heavyweights. newlinechar  newlinechar I'm admittedly not really a fan of the flippy style but it seems insane for them to not embrace that aspect of wrestling for at least the Cruiserweight division to appeal to the fans of that style. If it's what they do best and what got them the momentum and popularity that lead them to WWE in the first place, why try to completely change that? I could understand trying to fine tune them a bit but the way WWE seems to almost totally neuter them seems absurd and self-defeating. newlinechar  newlinechar It would be like restarting the Hardcore division, bringing in a bunch of CZW deathmatch-like guys and telling them to rarely use weapons, follow standard rules, and try to keep their bouts technical.

No, I completely get you, but take this. newlinechar  newlinechar A giant push coming at your tower. You have a little elixir but you know if you can get more time, you can stop that push with a Valk/heavy spell. You can't clone your towers, but freezing the push will come in handy while you finish off with your support. newlinechar  newlinechar Same with offense. Granted, you could clone the whole push and take a tower. But unless your opponent has no spells/heavies, it's not worth doing. Granted, it might work if your opponent runs like Golem or smth. But with the massive amount of tornadoes/exes, it's not worth the risk. newlinechar  newlinechar Freeze on the other hand might not be as versatile for its expensive elixir cost, but it's definitely far better at taking a tower quickly. Most people don't even see it coming, meaning that your Hog/win cond gets at least 2-3 shots off the tower before the opponent can react. True, it all depends on how you play the card. But in the long run, Freeze is more viable than Clone.
I don't think I'm brainwashed with Mou and yes the team can be entertaining under Mou, but IMO there is definitely a reluctance to lose more than a desire to win.

&gt; But more importantly, I strongly recommend watching playthrough videos (rather than reviews) of Gloomhaven and all games you are interested in.

However, my friend that loves playing thse games with me wants to get me something in the $30 range, so it's partly for her too. newlinechar   newlinechar &gt; Edit: Also, as a kindness to those who may view my Christmas list, I typically note a ''good'' price for a game just in case they go to Amazon at a bad time (stock is low) and see it listed for 3 x the normal price or something, they'll know to stay away. newlinechar  newlinechar When it comes to Amazon, I do the same.

So you do admit that Jews were slaughtered for being Jews? Even if the numbers were as low as 200,000 or however much the consensus was (I was into a lot conspiracy theories in my early 20s, but it's been awhile, and I do not subscribe to this one at all) why would the recognition of that genocide, whether 6 million or 200,000, be bothersome to you?  newlinechar  newlinechar Jews have had a continued presence in Israel for over 3,000 years.  newlinechar  newlinechar What perceived privileges have Jews had since the 40s, in your opinion?

I personally see the value in pure aestheticism, and I think it is inherently critical, whatever position its adherents take, since it shows up the travesty of the commodification of all things--that was Adorno's position as well by the way. The Kantian thing in itself, the aesthetic judgement, always stands against the incorporation of the market and reification. Having said that, Bloom's rejection of other ways of reading literature or appreciating art is a sign of his own small mindedness and his inability to value critical engagement with content, not only form. 
Those are all public settings with no pretense of silly behavior so no, no and no.

I'm no expert with pendletons, but as far as I can tell it seems almost brand new. My theory is a hipster bought it, then gave it away when his hipster friends called pendleton too mainstream.
Ok, how about this. There is no hold to ads. Multiple different hotkeys are bound to the same buttons. Changing hotkeys often breaks functionality, ie, rebinding crouch to another key makes you unable to dive. Your character constantly gets stuck on little things. Jumping(literally don't even have to say more). Doors open/close incorrectly. Netcode, laggy and stutter fps. The head Bob when you run /jump. Parachuting as you go to land. All of these things make the game feel incredibly clunky. newlinechar  newlinechar The inertia and momentum aren't what make the game feel clunky. You can have a game that has that feel crisp and responsive, a good example are the battlefield games. They have all the same mechanics as pubg, inertia momentum, bullet travel etc, but the game feels crisp and responsive and you feel completely in control of your character and actions. Everything about pubg is clunky, unwieldy, and buggy. You constantly feel like your character is doing shit you don't want, or the world isn't properly responding to your character, or it's lagging or the controls aren't crisp and responsive. I say this as a competitive player with over 700 hours. I love the game and can't wait for 1.0, but it's clunky as shit.

If you look on the home page, they're looking for people whose ancestry is from a lot of varying groups - I remember Eastern European, Indonesia, etc. off the top of my head. I think at the moment the people getting prioritized are those whose ancestry is all from one specific region, as that will help them with future ethnicity estimates. But as someone who also has no UK-centric DNA, and whose ancestry is a mish-mosh, I don't think there'd be much difference between us.

Yeah, the genius of Sparrow’s character in the first ones was that basically everyone (including the audience) mistakenly assumes that he’s a bumbling drunken fool who happens to get lucky every now and then. Norrington, Barbossa, and Beckett seem to consistently underestimate him. Then as things start to come together, you realize that he’s had a real plan this whole time and things are going the way he has wanted them to all along. It’s brilliant. Unfortunately, in the later films he’s become the bumbling fool people always thought he was. I want cunning, calculating Jack back! The flashback in Dead Men Tell No Tales is the best Jack we get in the whole movie. I really hope that they get it together for number 6. I’ve been majorly invested in these characters for like 13 yrs now.

&gt; Good, you admit it one way or another. newlinechar  newlinechar I never and would never deny that aspect of it. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; But your leadership did very little to combat this propaganda, in fact it only gave it more munition. Don´t deny this. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  Serbs were turned from a constituent people into a minority, which they last were (with the exception of WWII) in Austria-Hungary. newlinechar  newlinechar Was there even a legal stature of a constituent people in A-U? newlinechar  newlinechar To my knowledge, Serbs received that legal status only with the formation of the SFRJ. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Had they not risen up they´d be stuck living in a country they still feared with minority rights, separate from Serbia, something they ancestors fought to make sure wouldn´t be the case. newlinechar  newlinechar Yeah, but they would remain alive, with their homes and land, in Croatia...and there would be no war. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; I don´t consider either side the victim in the last war. newlinechar  newlinechar I disagree. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt;  I do believe that you had the right to secede, but only if the Serbs in Croatia were also allowed to secede, that is stay with Yugoslavia. Otherwise it´s double standards. newlinechar  newlinechar But neither SFRJ or the international community gave any legal standing on separatist movements within established political entities, which the SR Croatia and then RH was. newlinechar  newlinechar So there is absolutely no legal basis for secession or the RSK whatsoever. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Had they remained in the homes they would have certainly been subject to attacks, bullying, discrimination and quite possible ethnic cleansing anyways. newlinechar  newlinechar There would have been crimes absolutely, but nothing of the apocalyptic sort it is often propagated. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; As for Z-4, it´s not as clear cut as you make it out to be. I do agree that rejecting it was a massive mistake, but don´t act like you guys wanted peace. newlinechar  newlinechar The Z-4 was fully formed and ready to take place. newlinechar  newlinechar Croatia obviously wanted to destroy the RSK, there is no denying that, but the RSK rejecting all the deals really furthers Croatia's legitimacy for launching Operation Storm. newlinechar  newlinechar The rejection of the Z-4 cemented that. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; but I can refuse to accept their decision. I doubt many of you people are too happy about Vojo getting released. newlinechar  newlinechar Well, there is still chance for Vojo to be sentenced. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Again, read what I said before. One day, when the world order shifts away from the US and NATO, presumably to China and maybe Russia, that decision will be painted as something shameful the west made possible. newlinechar  newlinechar Neither of them will care, at all. newlinechar  newlinechar We are irrelevant small countries.

It doesn't matter what I would rather, but what is a realistic possibility. Often, it pays to examine headlines with skepticism, rather than idealism. newlinechar  newlinechar A better example would be, would you rather have $500 and spend $500 on rent, or have $10,000 and spend $10,000 on rent? Housing is the probably the least adaptive resource we have, and when everyone is now willing to pay double to get an apartment, well the base price will be double what it was, helping no one. These things need to be managed with care and rigor.

I suppose I feel that drugs will always be stigmatized when we do fuck up with them and take it too far or ignore information, and for drug use to be more accepted, we and the next generation need to behave better to be living proof that drugs can be enjoyed responsibly. I feel his platform on YouTube and the nature of videos themselves gives Adam a louder voice and a wider audience than we have here discussing the same issues, and that's why I'm maybe being a bit strict - he is an authority on the subject to many inexperienced users, he has an influence over people's lives. Even if he never intended to be. I hold him to a higher standard as a result. newlinechar  newlinechar It's nice that you enjoy his videos and I do respect that they take a lot of time and balls to make. I really do. Since we can't undo the past, I would actually like to see Adam address more the potential problems with drug use such as addiction, in the same way he is open about the joys of drugs. I feel he could give personal insight into that and it's definitely something that shouldn't be covered up when promoting drug use

It does if that minor fits the profile of the sexual orientation you declared. Can you not see how his sexual gender preference is directly related to this situation because of the sex of who he allegedly molested? It doesn't mean that those who share his gender preferance also share the fact that they like underage people and it doesn't imply that in any way.  If the gender of who he molested was unknown then him saying he was gay would be completely irrelevant yes. But we know that him molesting a young boy is more plausible knowing he is gay because that boy falls within his preferred gender.

Use of the passive voice obscures the truth here.

These are extremely bold claims which require good evidence.

Lithium batteries should significantly outlast AGMs so over their lifetime they will actually cost less. newlinechar  newlinechar My lithium bank cost about $500 per 100Ah. You can't compare ratings directly because you can draw lithium batteries down to 20% without reducing their life cycles. Lead acid batteries can only go down to 50%. 310Ah of lead acid have 155Ah usable. That's 194Ah of lithium batteries, or about $1000. newlinechar  newlinechar Lithium charges tend to be more expensive too, so there's an additional cost there. newlinechar  newlinechar I understand why many people choose AGMs over lithium. If you don't have the budget for them or don't want to put in the extra effort it will require, AGMs make sense.

&gt; I think we need to pair UBI with a way to ensure that essential goods and services are kept at a competitive price point to ensure society doesn't break down.  newlinechar  newlinechar That's not really an issue.  If more people have the money to spend (and especially low income people who don't save), then more money is being put into the economy.  The only things you would see being bought less are the generic brand items at the grocery store, while the big name items would be bought more.  Essentially, it would be better for the market than if there are more people living off welfare who are unable to afford expensive or luxury items.

How does them walking to the objective change anything? Assuming the husk doesn't spawn exactly where you stand, you still have a downtime with melee weapon that a ranged one wouldn't have.   newlinechar Bullets needs to be reloaded, and that's for a reason : They dish out **ALOT** more damage. newlinechar It is true that melee cleaves (and it is the only thing that melee does better than ranged weapon if we ignore rocket launchers). So that makes melee **situationally** better than Ranged weapons. To get an idea of how much target you'd need, let's take quick comparison.   newlinechar A lvl 1 Pressure Cutter, the weapon used in your gif; [would deal 972 dmg every 0.8seconds using my stats](https://vgy.me/QpTVqp.png). This would get an additionnal 25% dmg from Assassination, assuming I've been consistently hitting before, and would deal 30% of its damage over time after first hit.   newlinechar [Now the Meta AR, which deals 439.8 dmg 12 times per seconds with  my stats](https://vgy.me/JD7IKv.png). Now that is 5 277,6 Dps, but to be fair since you talked about reload, I'll take its dps over two magazines; 2.5s of shooting, 2.3s reloading, 2.5s shooting : 3614. This would take the classic soldier +10%Dmg ranged weapon perk, aswell as 24% increased AR damage. (Not even mentioning debiliting shot, +40% Ammo capacity perk/+30% reloadspeed perk, War cry... etc)   newlinechar Not going further in the maths, you can already see on paper that you'd need to consistently be hitting *atleast* 4 target to be on par with an AR, which is quite unlikely.   newlinechar Does that makes melee not viable? No. Does that makes melee high risk - low reward? Yup, definitly. newlinechar

&gt; Yeah that 2 in 16 years number looks pretty rosy if you ignore foreign-born Muslims newlinechar  newlinechar No, that number *is* foreign-born Muslims. Not ignoring them. As a matter of fact, a significant portion of my argument is that we should be focused on domestic terrorism, a far larger issue, than foreign terrorism. newlinechar  newlinechar &gt; Also 16 years is quite the odd timeframe to choose. Did something happen in the 17th year? newlinechar  newlinechar Because *that's* when everyone started calling for Muslims to be banned from entering the country, not when foreign-executed terrorism is at a near all-time low. I use that timeframe because, before then, hardly anyone even *considered* relating Muslims and terrorism, and so factual, verifiable information and studies regarding the relation before then are rather hard to come by, even with the internet at our disposal.

Assuming you can control when you sneeze
First, Peevyhouse (aside from the fact that case is only enforceable in Oklahoma) is not standing for the principle you are seeking to establish. What you are talking here is a different type of remedy. You are talking about the difference in value of a property to *damage to property* caused through an otherwise enforceable contract, and a breach of that contract. That is a different property right than the value of *deprivation of a property right.*  newlinechar  newlinechar When talking breach of contract, that is different then trying to have a contract voided. That is, breach of contract remedies are generally one of three things: (1) the harm caused by the breach; (2) returning the person to the position they were in before the contract; or (3) giving the person the benefit they would've received had the contract been fulfilled (this is the hardest to obtain--and often not given by judges) newlinechar  newlinechar edit: also, to your point about consideration. You are generally correct, Judges do not weigh the value of consideration, of course with exceptions. But, you are not seeking to void the contract because it was not a valid contract as a whole (offer, acceptance, *a meeting of the minds*, &amp; consideration) but rather you are seeking to find part of the contract void or voidable. Certainly contracts are entered into that are voidable. There is indeed an entire section on voidability in every contracts textbook

A bicycle is a luxury item, food is a necessity. This is very simple morality. I believe it is okay to steal food if you are hungry or your child/dependent is hungry, or to trade drugs for food if you are poor and have drugs which have value and someone else has food which has value. The person who steals the baby formula to trade for drugs likely knows the baby they are stealing the food for. Of all the things for people to steal or trade for drugs, baby formula is the one I have the least problem with, because ultimately an innocent baby who is likely in a horrible situation already is the benefactor.

The copying is not the only element of learning the spell. The wizard still has to spend time mastering it and deciphering the translation. The purpose of the purchase costs in inks is because the wizard must translate it to their own ability and practice making the runes. Having the familiar copy it is a lot like taking the spellbook to a photocopier. It's not exact and doesn't feature any of the practice to master the exact strokes. It's just a copy. It's faulty. It should backfire if the character doesn't spend the time mastering the spells and transcribing them by hand himself.  newlinechar  newlinechar It's a creative way to get a copy of the book, but it doesn't feature the main component of learning the spell.

When I said 'personal judgment' I am also factoring in what you say above before reaching my best judgment. newlinechar  newlinechar In my personal judgment, the accumulation of evidence I have heard overwhelms the arguments you are making and I am a believer in many so-called paranormal things and now the ME also. I also think Theosophical,  Vedic (Hindu) and certain esoteric wisdom traditions explain our so-called paranormal as part and parcel of the normal in an expanded understanding of the universe that involves planes of reality beyond direct detection by our physical senses and instruments. They are detectable though through psychic sensing.  And so much consistent anecdotal data dovetails with the worldview presented in these wisdom traditions.  newlinechar  newlinechar I have considered what you say but I in the end judge it to be the best attempt to 'explain away' that which has a quantity, quality and consistency of evidence. The more expanded view presented by these other traditions is the more plausible one in my judgment. newlinechar

Well, you were originally justifying your stance against competition in part by making an appeal to the authority of Morihei Ueshiba, and my point was that this is a little tricky.

We should reach out to all the reviewers and tell them to go to their nearest deli to see how Face ID works. /s newlinechar  newlinechar In all seriousness though, many reviewers did more robust testing and had the device much longer than the 24 hours Nilay had. Matt Panzarino from TechCrunch, for example, spent 7+ days with it and took it on a family vacation to Disneyland. Used it extensively in harsh direct sunlight and says he didn't have the issues Nilay is talking about. 
I don’t have selective memory. Nor am I salty, i don’t think it was predetermined. It was just one of those things that as soon as Hanley committed that error, I felt like i was going to lose. It was more me in my head than anything, which I get that. I was just wondering if it happened to anyone else. Wasn’t trying to start a conspiracy. 
By definition, the percentages used are NOT arbitrary. If you don't guage threat by statistics, then you are gauging it by subjective and untrue 'feelings' which is worse, wouldn't you agree?  Feelings not based in fact are capricious but threat based on statistics is accurate.

Yep. Shimano makes it serviceable for that reason. It’s like having a clutch in a car. It just wears down after moving enough. Suspension movement (if you have a FS), shifting, and your oval ring (to a small extent) will wear out the clutch. It’s a very simple operation for even a home mechanic. Cheers!

I've mostly got an issue with it because it feels like every (sufficiently rated) video game is like this. When even silly adventure-pulp Tomb Raider isn't much less extreme than this it loses its ability to shock. The 'crazed cultist' villain also isn't very unique (and again, even Tomb Raider did this). newlinechar  newlinechar Exercising some taste with what they were showing would at least keep the qualtiy of the scene up even if it does feel like every video game now is violent and shocking to the point of approaching the horror genre.

Really depends on the substance and the active dose. For something like etizolam, 100ug from a volumetric solution is totally reasonable, whereas for 3-FPM, 1 or 2 mg would suffice.  newlinechar  newlinechar Of course, if a reagent test comes back with inconsistent results, it's best to discard your sample totally. Or if you're willing to take the risk, starting on the extreme lower end, like 100 ug, is a good starting point.

It is you as a user, specifically, every single time this discussion comes up, triggering Automod throughout the thread every single time.

Trump is not society.  Society is a collective.  It is you, I , and all our neighbours deciding on a common set of standards to live by. newlinechar  newlinechar I don't just focus on the Bible.  However, the Bible is held up as some kind of moral standard when it can be easily demonstrated to be anything but. newlinechar  newlinechar No, Death Camps do not meet my standard of morality.  You fail to grasp the point.  Morality is the standard that society stamps upon itself.  Morality evolves over time.  What was moral in Nazi Germany (and I'm not sure that German society would have thought it moral - it was basically a subset of individuals that created and managed them - and they did it in secret), is not necessarily moral now. newlinechar  newlinechar I am not defending any past set of moral standards, just pointing out that what was moral 4000 years ago is not moral now.

I agree, addiction and other unwanted things that come from drug use should be gone over just as much as the joys of drug use.

I actually wrote him off and didnt watch any more of his videos until I later saw an interesting one posted here on Reddit. I’ll agree that he has a couple videos I’m not fond of but what Youtuber doesn’t have a lesser quality video here or there?  newlinechar  newlinechar If someone is a drug user and they are putting out information on the internet like he is, their content will be a little biased, as hard as he tries not to be.
